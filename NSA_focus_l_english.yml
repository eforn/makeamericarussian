 nasa.1.d:0 ""Savages! All of them!" The voice of Bill Nelson rang through the council room at Cape Canaveral. The room was once the meeting area for interstellar missions into the cosmos for many years, now it was a war room. The small group of men within the room were all somber as the looked toward Nelson. These men were men of intellect and genius. They had sent man into the stars through their meticulous calculations and careful planning. Not even that could prepare them for the struggle upcoming. \n\n"We cannot allow for the first opportunity America has had for technological rebirth to be ruined by the evils of mankind." Nelson continued. "We must use our superority in mind to outwit our enemies to secure a better tomorrow. Far too long have we been pressed upon the heel of bureaucracy as a pawn or toy. Today marks the beginning of real goverment; one lead by those smart enough to do so.""

The council was in the room alone, no transcribers, no reporters, no cameras, not even a single cell phone. The past few months had been bloody and troublesome. Winning a war with no one single man in charge of the nation was problem enough. Getting soldiers to fight for that cause was even harder. However, NASA had still managed to emerge victorious in the war and was now set to take Florida to new hieghts. Who knows what's in store?"

The former adminstration for space flight known as The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, or NASA, has taken control of the Floridian peninsula after months of bloody fighting. Many news outlets have tried to obtain information from the area but have been turned away at every turn. It seem that whatever NASA is doing, they are keeping it top secret."
