 #Stages Intro
 ins.1.t:0 "Negotiations with Russia - STAGE 1"
 ins.1.d:0 "''Vas privetstvuyet Rossiyskaya Federatsiya.'' - Seems like the videoconference has started. \n\n ''The Russian Federation greets you, [ROOT.GetLeader], and of course [ROOT.GetName]. We already know why are you adressing us.'' - says Vladimir Putin's translator - ''The situation on the American continent is a mess, and to he honest, we have very little interest in helping you restore the order.'' \n\n ''Perhaps if you had proven to us you are the worthy ally. Russia always rewards loyal friends.'' - Putin smiled after that phrase was translated \n\n ''So first, we need to make sure there is going to be an understanding between our governments. We support governments that value the order, and discipline - and those that aim for the tradition. The question now is; do you think your state is going to be capable of cooperation with us?''"
 ins.1.a:0 "''We have a great government focused around the [ROOT.GetRulingIdeology] values''"
 ins.1.b:0 "''Our government might be [ROOT.GetRulingIdeology], but I hope we will get along''"

 ins.2.t:0 "Negotiations with Russia - STAGE 2"
 ins.2.d:0 "''Well, we are mostly delighted.'' - Putin smiles from the camera. \n\n ''. - ''Indeed, we can cooperate with [ROOT.GetRulingIdeology] authorities. And that cooperation is going to be most likely fruitful. But that's just the beggining'' - Putin went silent for a minute after those words \n\n ''Pragmatism is a virtue. We do not expect anything breathtaking, but we surely do like to see what path of the development you've picked. Our generals may need to cooperate with yours, and thus we need to make sure you will cope with our methods and people.'' \n\n ''The only interest of aggressive forces of NATO is in pacifying you. We also can't hide ours - and ours is to spread the Russian influence over the American continent. For that, we will need to know what strategies your staff prefers, and for how long you're going to persist. We're honest, and we want a honest answer - what are your military capabilities?''"
 ins.2.a:0 "''[ROOT.GetName] is strong, and is on its way to reunite the USA!''"
 ins.2.b:0 "''Our strategy will adapt to yours, Mr. Vladimir''"
 ins.3.t:0 "Negotiations with Russia - STAGE 3"
 ins.3.d:0 "''It seems, our army is impressed with your military strategies and potential! You are really an ally worthy consideration.'' - Putin smiles. \n\n ''. - ''I can already see there will be a good cooperation between our nations. Although, those that give should also receive. We do not ask for much, and at this point we will count on your courtesy.'' \n\n ''We are in need of your people, not normal people though - academics. The Federation would be happy to receive the brightest minds you can get in your state. We won't keep them for long, if you agree...'' \n\n ''...Friend.'' - finished Putin's translator"
 ins.3.a:0 "''May this be an act of our friendship. We accept your request.''"
 ins.3.b:0 "''[ROOT.GetName] must respectfully refuse, but we wish you the best.''"
 ins.4.t:0 "Negotiations with Russia - COMPLETED"
 ins.4.d:0 "Putin rises from his chair smiling and then turns to whisper to the translator man. After a while, the result of our negotiations is known. \n\n ''Russian Federation is proud to announce that [ROOT.GetName] is a nation that will be given our full aid. We recognize you as a state that struggles to follow the Russian interests and policy, and thus shall rightfully restore the order on the American continent.'' \n\n''Your efforts are great and we have no doubts that our cooperation will prove to be more fruitful than we could've expected. We will stay in touch and watch you closely. Keep the firm hand over your people, [ROOT.GetLeader].''"

 ins.5.t:0 "Negotiations with Russia - STAGE 2"
 ins.5.d:0 "''Your government is problematic, and does not see the reason of any cooperation between us. The [ROOT.GetRulingIdeology] government you represent thinks it cares about people while it's losing the struggle of controlling and guiding its people. It's definately not a good beggining, but let's not get ahead of the facts.'' - Putin coughs while translator speaks. \n\n ''Pragmatism is a virtue. We do not expect anything breathtaking, but we surely do like to see what path of the development you've picked. Our generals may need to cooperate with yours, and thus we need to make sure you will cope with our methods and people.'' \n\n ''The only interest of aggressive forces of NATO is in pacifying you.

 ins.6.d:0 "''Your army... or what you call an army. How to put that - it doesn't meet our standards. Perhaps in your eyes its great, but your strategies and army traditions... Our staff is disappointed.'' - Putin seems to be discontent. \n\n ''Perhaps our army won't be too eager to work with yours, but still there's something you could help us with. We are in need of your people, not normal people though - academics. The Federation would be happy to receive the brightest minds you can get in your state. We won't keep them for long, if you agree...'' \n\n ''...Better you agree.'' - finished Putin's translator"

In our opinion - don't take this personally, but you have no strategical value to us. And that's a shame because we saw a potential in you, potential you've wasted. \n\n''We need to support states that show at least minimal initiative and support towards our interets. There's no reason to keep diplomatical channels opened. Goodbye, [ROOT.GetLeader]. Perhaps you'll be the one to bring order to America. Perhaps not. But until then we have nothing to discuss.''"
