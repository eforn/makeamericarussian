 IDA_Promote_Veterans_To_Command_Positions_desc:0 "To help alleviate the issues with our armed forces, we will promote veterans to command positions. Though this isn't a perfect solution, the experience brought by these veterans should rub off on their subordinates."
 IDA_Increase_Taxation:0 "Increase Taxation"
 IDA_Increase_Taxation_desc:0 "Though incredibly unpopular with our support base, our dire need of funds has warranted us to support an increase in taxes. With a larger budget, we will be able to devote more resources to improving our small industrial base."

 IDA_War_Plan_Brown:0 "War Plan §cBrown§!"
 IDA_War_Plan_Brown_desc:0 "With most of Idaho and Wyoming being under the control of Montana, it only makes sense that it would be one of our first targets. Thus, we have developed War Plan Brown in preparation for our dealings with Montana."    
 IDA_Allies_Up_North:0 "Allies Up North"

 IDA_Lessons_From_The_Big_Sky_Country_desc:0 "The invasion of Montana has proven to be a great learning experience for both our commanders, and our soldiers.

 # War Plan Yellow - Utah #
 IDA_War_Plan_Yellow:0 "War Plan §YYellow§!"
 IDA_War_Plan_Yellow_desc:0 "With Utah having derailed our original plans in the first place, it only makes sense we'd take advantage of the chaos south of our border. With this in mind, War Plan Yellow has been devised with the goal of subjugating the entire southwest through any means necessary."

 IDA_Support_The_Mormons_desc:0 "Despite being the ones to betray us, the LDS Church is a much more reliable ally than a ragtag group of criminals and secessionists. With that said, it would be advantageous for us to support Utah in it's war against the Freedom Coalition. For if they win, they may just come running back to us after all."
 IDA_Support_The_Freedom_Coalition:0 "Support the §GFr§!§Yeed§!§Gom§! §YCoa§!§Glit§!§Yion§!" 
 IDA_Support_The_Freedom_Coalition_desc:0 "Though backing the Freedom Coalition may be a questionable move (considering a good portion of them are convicted criminals) there are some valid reasons in doing do. Aside from the obvious reason of teaching Utah a lesson, the Freedom Coalition is significantly weaker than Utah. Thus should they win the war, we will have a much easier time conquering the southwest." 
 IDA_Direct_Intervention:0 "Direct Intervention"
 IDA_Direct_Intervention_desc:0 "Though we were satisfied with observing the war from the sidelines, it has dragged on for far too long, and we can't afford to wait any longer.

 IDA_Allies_Down_South:0 "Allies Down South"
 IDA_Allies_Down_South_desc:0 "Through an unexpected turn of events, Utah has returned to having a Trumpist-aligned government. We must take full advantage of this situation, and ask them to rejoin our faction. Though there's no guarantee they'll join us, the least we can do is try."
 IDA_Operation_Beekeeper:0 "Operation §YBee§!§gkee§!§Yper§!"
 IDA_Operation_Beekeeper_desc:0 "Though they were successful in their war against the Freedom Coalition, it appears Utah has truly abandoned President Trump and his cause. As such, it is our duty to reel them back into our domain, and secure Utah once and for all."
 IDA_Operation_Prometheus:0 "Operation §RPro§!§Ometh§!§Yeus§!"
 IDA_Operation_Prometheus_desc:0 "With the Freedom Coalition having come out victorious against Utah, we must make our move to secure our position as soon as possible. The plan is simple, punch through to Salt Lake CIty on I-15 and I-80 before fanning out from there. We've already come this far, a ragtag group of escaped convicts won't stop us now."
 IDA_Unexpected_Allies:0 "Unexpected Allies"
 IDA_Unexpected_Allies_desc:0 "With their victory over Utah, no one expected the members of the Freedom Coalition to turn to President Trump for support, but now they have. This unprecedented move has allowed us the opportunity to ask them to join us in our crusade to reunite the West. Though we can't guarantee they'll actually join us, there's no harm in trying."
 IDA_Utahn_Military_Advisors:0 "Utahn Military Advisors"
 IDA_Utahn_Military_Advisors_desc:0 "With our (mostly) peaceful pacification of the southwest, we can now reap the rewards it entails. One of these rewards is access to Utah's military staff, and training facilities. With these, we can progress further in our goal to professionalize our army."

 IDA_Masters_Of_The_Rockies_desc:0 "Through our hard work and a few strokes of luck, we have managed to take control over the Mountain West.

 # Air Force Improvement #
 IDA_To_Dominate_The_Skies:0 "To Dominate the Skies"
 IDA_To_Dominate_The_Skies_desc:0 "A sufficient air force is one of the crucial pieces of a modern army. Though we lacked the resources to improve our air force earlier, with our newfound wealth, improving our air force has become a top priority. With the first priority of any air force being to dominate the skies while denying your opponents the same access, it is only sensible we work on improving our air superiority capabilities first."
 IDA_A_Question_Of_Doctrine:0 "A Question of Doctrine"
 IDA_A_Question_Of_Doctrine_desc:0 "Though we've got to work on securing the skies, we must decide on a doctrine before we proceed any further. We have two options before us, we can focus on strategic bombing, crippling the industry of our foes; we can focus on battlefield support; raining fire from the skies; or we can try doing a bit of both." 
 IDA_Bolster_Aircraft_Production:0 "Bolster Aircraft Production"
 IDA_Bolster_Aircraft_Production_desc:0 "As we were late in establishing a proper air force, we must make an effort to increase aircraft production if we are to catch up with our peers."
 IDA_Improve_Anti_Air_Capabilities:0 "Improve Anti-Air Capabilities"
 IDA_Improve_Anti_Air_Capabilities_desc:0 "Though our air force should be sufficient in contesting the skies, it doesn't hurt to prepare our ground forces for any unexpected holes in our defense."
 IDA_Reinstate_Air_Force_Generals:0 "Reinstate Air Force Generals"
 IDA_Reinstate_Air_Force_Generals_desc:0 "When the Western Command Zone was first established, all generals of the Wyoming and Idaho National Guard were discharged in a move to endure loyalty to President Trump. Now, with our position secure, we have begun the process of reinstating generals of the Air National Guard. This move will allow us to draw on much needed talent, while maintaining the current political situation."  
 IDA_Contract_Flight_Training_Companies:0 "Contract Flight Training Companies"
 IDA_Contract_Flight_Training_Companies_desc:0 "With our ever-growing need to train pilots, we have found an unlikely solution to our issue, private companies. Various private companies at home, and abroad, offer private air services, and training, to anyone willing to pay the price. With our newfound wealth in the Rockies, we should take advantage of these offers while they're available to us."
 IDA_Eagles_Of_The_West:0 "Eagles of the West"
 IDA_Eagles_Of_The_West_desc:0 "We've come a long way since the beginnings of our air force. Our journey has been marked by our great success in reforming from a shabby fleet of biplanes, to a competent force of fighters, bombers, and close air support. Now, it is time we take our position among the skies with the rest of our peers, a vanguard for freedom in the west." 
 # War Plan Orange - Cascadia #
 IDA_War_Plan_Orange:0 "War Plan §OOrange§!"
 IDA_War_Plan_Orange_desc:0 "The current situation in Cascadia is one that can greatly benefit us. They are politically isolated, having split off from California shortly before the Good Friday agreement, and there is much discontent between the heavily conservative populations of the east, and the liberal populations of the coast. This isolation and instability make Cascadia a prime target for us, and we must act quick if we are to catch them off guard."
 IDA_Work_With_Shea:0 "Work with Shea"
 IDA_Work_With_Shea_desc:0 "Matt Shea, and the state of Liberty overall, represent the frustrations rural conservatives have living under the boot of liberal urbanites. This makes them the perfect allies to reach out for support in fighting Cascadia."
 IDA_Operation_Inquisition:0 "Operation §RInquisition§!"
 IDA_Operation_Inquisition_desc:0 "Despite their populous' conservative views, the state of Liberty has fallen to the rule of extremists. As such, working with them is completely out of the question, and our only business with them is to liberate their repressed populations."
 IDA_Operation_Evergreen:0 "Operation §GEvergreen§!"
 IDA_Operation_Evergreen_desc:0 "With Liberty having been dealt with, we can now turn our attention to the real prize, Cascadia. The plan is simple, we'll follow I-84 and I-90 west, and drive our way to the strongholds of Portland and Seattle. Cascadia will be ours!." 
 IDA_Proclaim_Shea_As_Governor_Of_Washington:0 "Proclaim Shea as Governor of Washington"
 IDA_Proclaim_Shea_As_Governor_Of_Washington_desc:0 "The loyalty shown to us by Matt Shea and the people of Liberty has not gone unnoticed. As a reward for their loyalty, we shall grant them dominion over Washington state. The socialists of Seattle shall finally learn what true freedom feels like."
 IDA_Integrate_Cascadia:0 "Integrate Cascadia"

 IDA_Reopen_Cascadian_Universities:0 "Reopen Cascadian Universities"
 IDA_Reopen_Cascadian_Universities_desc:0 "Though the schools of Washington and Oregon aren't too well known, they are still institutes of research. As such, we should take the time to reopen these universities to bolster our research capabilities."
 # War Plan White - California #
 IDA_War_Plan_White:0 "War Plan White"
 IDA_War_Plan_White_desc:0 "With our goals nearly in sight, only one obstacle really stands in our way, the Democrat bastion of California. Most of our troops have been planning for an invasion from California for nearly a decade, and now here we are, right at the doorstep of The Golden State, ready to settle it once and for all."
 IDA_Operation_Wolverine:0 "Operation §RWolverine§!"
 IDA_Operation_Wolverine_desc:0 "California: the socialist bastion, the land of liberals, the place where "conservative" Republicans betrayed President Trump for a dictator. Now, our troops stand at their doorstep, poised to reclaim the land President Reagan once called, "The place where good Republicans go to die.""
 IDA_Meet_With_Jenner:0 "Meet with Jenner"
 IDA_Meet_With_Jenner_desc:0 "To the absolute shock of every American, California has declared its loyalty to President Trump, and the Trumpist cause. The one behind this, celebrity turned politician, Caitlyn Jenner, now wields a considerable amount of power, and if we are to satisfy President Trump's demands, we must negotiate with them."  
 IDA_Integrate_California:0 "Integrate California"
 IDA_Integrate_California_desc:0 "With our conquest of California, we must now get to work on integrating our new found territories. Though the large liberal populations of Los Angeles and the Bay Area might give us some trouble, many Californians are die-hard conservatives, making our job just a bit easier."
 IDA_Reopen_Californian_Univeristies:0 "Reopen Californian Universities"
 IDA_Reopen_Californian_Univeristies_desc:0 "Despite their reputation for turning our radical socialists, Californian universities remain some of the best in the country, and the research they conduct is invaluable. In direct result to this, it is in our best interest to encourage the continued operation of these institutions to better our research capabilities."  
 # End of West Coast Campaign, Beginning of the War Plan Indigo (Alaska and Hawaii focus)  #
 IDA_War_Plan_Indigo:0 "War Plan §BIndigo§!"
 IDA_War_Plan_Indigo_desc:0 "War Plan Indigo deals with the U.S. Pacific Fleet (or whatever is left with it,) and in particular, Hawaii and Alaska. Being removed from the continental United States, makes these areas significantly hard to invade, especially taking into account our lack of a proper navy. However, this will not deter us, and we'll bring them back into the fold one way or another." 
 # Naval Buildup #
 IDA_Expand_Our_Naval_Capabilities:0 "Expand our Naval Capabilities"
 IDA_Expand_Our_Naval_Capabilities_desc:0 "As we were, for our entire existence, landlocked, we have not had to worry about producing or maintaining a navy. Now that our attention has turned to the states of Alaska and Hawaii the issue of a navy has come to our attention. First off, we must compensate for our lack of a navy by focusing by increasing our naval production capabilities."
 IDA_Purchase_Foriegn_Ships:0 "Purchase Foreign Ships"
 IDA_Purchase_Foriegn_Ships_desc:0 "Though we've been busy producing our own warships, we currently have a desperate need for them. As such, we must look to purchasing foreign ships in order to supplement our fleet."
 IDA_Reach_Out_To_Coast_Guard_Admirals:0 "Reach Out to Coast Guard Admirals"
 IDA_Reach_Out_To_Coast_Guard_Admirals_desc:0 "Every navy needs competent admirals, which is sadly, something we can not provide ourselves. As such, it would be wise to reach out to former officers of the Coast Guard to help lead our navy."
 IDA_Our_Own_Marine_Corps:0 "Our Own Marine Corps"
 IDA_Our_Own_Marine_Corps_desc:0 "As our attention turns towards the states of Hawaii and Alaska, the question of having a dedicated maritime land force has been raised. Though not necessarily our highest priority, creating one may help us in any future invasions should they pop up."
 # Operation Aloha - Pacific Fleet/Hawaii #
 IDA_The_Fleet_In_California:0 "The Fleet in California"
 IDA_The_Fleet_In_California_desc:0 "As expected, the U.S. Pacific Fleet has managed to wring California back from the hands of the socialists. Unfortunately for us, the leadership of the Pacific Fleet has gone on to declare all participants in the civil war, including President Trump and Joe Biden, as enemies of the state. They could have been incredibly useful allies to our cause, but now they're just another roadblock in the way of our ultimate goal."
 IDA_A_Tropical_Paradise:0 "A Tropical Paradise"
 IDA_A_Tropical_Paradise_desc:0 "After the arrest of Admiral Aquilino and subsequent collapse of the Pacific Fleet, the state of Hawaii has been able to enjoy a period of peace and isolation away from the conflict on the mainland U.S. However, now that our attention has turned west, only time will tell whether Hawaii can maintain its status quo."
 IDA_Operation_Aloha:0 "Operation §RAl§!§Oo§!§Yha§!"
 IDA_Operation_Aloha_desc:0 "With our forces in place, we can finally begin an assault on the Pacific Fleet, and their bastion of Hawaii. This will be one of our first major fights where naval supremacy will be a deciding factor, but our command staff is certain we will come out on top. We shall rule the waves!" 
 IDA_Negotiate_With_Hawaii:0 "Negotiate with Hawaii" 
 IDA_Negotiate_With_Hawaii_desc:0 "With Hawaii having sided with President Trump, there really isn't much need to negotiate with them. That said, given that we are far closer to them than they are to the President, it would be much more logical for them to join us for now." 
 IDA_Bypass_Hawaii:0 "Bypass Hawaii"
 IDA_Bypass_Hawaii_desc:0 "Being an easily fortifiable island that's rather far from the continental U.S., our command staff has deemed Hawaii to be no where near worth the effort needed to capture the islands. As such, it has been recommended we just leave Hawaii to itself for now, while we deal with more pressing matters."
 IDA_Integrate_Our_New_Territories:0 "Integrate Our New Territories"
 IDA_Integrate_Our_New_Territories_desc:0 "With the fleet and its remnants having been defeated we can finally get to integrating our newly conquered territories. Of course, we have a good number of dissenters to our rule, but in time we'll have these areas secure." 
 # Operation Snowbird - Alaska #
 IDA_The_Last_Frontier:0 "The Last Frontier"
 IDA_The_Last_Frontier_desc:0 "Having broke away from the Pacific Fleet after the arrest of admiral John Aquilino, the state of Alaska's remote location has allowed for a rather "unique" political situation to develop. Of course, now that we've turned our attention towards their way, we are obligated to bring them back into the domain with the rest of the U.S.\n\n§CIt's about time someone tame "The Last Frontier."§!"
 IDA_Bypass_Alaska:0 "Bypass Alaska"
 IDA_Bypass_Alaska_desc:0 "Despite the potential resources Alaska may provide us, our command staff has deemed attempting to obtain Alaska as worth far more effort than its actually worth. As such, we will ignore issue of Alaska for the time being, and revisit this issue at a later date."
 IDA_Meet_With_Palin:0 "Meet with Palin"
 IDA_Meet_With_Palin_desc:0 "Though Sarah Palin was known for her heavy support of President Trump before the civil war, it now seems she has no interest in getting the state of Alaska involved in the affairs of the mainland. That said, Palin's devotion to neutrality in the conflict puts Alaska in an ideal position we can negotiate with. We should take this opportunity while we have the chance."
 IDA_Operation_Snowbird:0 "Operation §CSno§!wb§Cird§!"
 IDA_Operation_Snowbird_desc:0 "Alaska's relative isolation has made it the prime target for our next conquest. Without the full protection of the U.S. Pacific Fleet and few allies who are too far to be a threat, we should have little problem launching a full out assault to reclaim Alaska for our cause."
 IDA_Integrate_Alaska:0 "Integrate Alaska"
 IDA_Integrate_Alaska_desc:0 "With our dominion over Alaska secure, we must get to properly integrating the Alaskan population. Though the industrial capacity gained through this is rather limited, gaining access  to Alaska's oil rich deposits more than makes up for it."  
 # End of the Western Conquests, Start of the "political" tree #
 IDA_Mission_Accomplished:0 "§RMission§! Accomp§Blished§!"
 IDA_Mission_Accomplished_desc:0 "Finally, after years of struggling, we have successfully completed our mission of reuniting the Western United States.

 IDA_Formalize_Our_Alliance_desc:0 "Though, officially, we've always been a part of President Trump's territory, in practice we've been allowed to operate under high levels of autonomy in order to achieve our goals. Now that we've completed our objectives, it's time we truly become a part of President Trump's America."

 IDA_Revive_American_Imperialism_desc:0 "By the order of President Trump, we have been tasked with subjugating the entire North American continent and bringing these states back into the American sphere.

 IDA_Neo_Monroe_Doctrine:0 "Renew the Monroe Doctrine"
 IDA_Neo_Monroe_Doctrine_desc:0 "When it was first established, the Monroe Doctrine was a foreign policy position that established American dominion over the Americas. Now that we've been tasked with subjugating the rest of the continent, much of our command staff have suggested that a revival of the Monroe Doctrine is in order." 
 IDA_Return_To_The_Pacific:0 "Return to the Pacific"
 IDA_Return_To_The_Pacific_desc:0 "A short while ago, we had made the decision to ignore the Pacific region in order to focus on more important matters. Now that our position is more secure, we have returned to deal with this issue and bring the Pacific back into the fold, once in for all." 
 IDA_The_Fruits_Of_Loyalty:0 "The Fruits of Loyalty"
 IDA_The_Fruits_Of_Loyalty_desc:0 "As our name suggests, we hold dominion over the entire Western United States. This however, isn't entirely true. Parts of Eastern Wyoming, Colorado, and Montana were directly administered by the east, due to their high populations, and safe location. Now that the situation is no longer as dire as it used to be, we now have the chance to ask that these territories be transferred to our control."
 IDA_War_Plan_Crimson:0 "War Plan §RCrimson§!"
 IDA_War_Plan_Crimson_desc:0 "The invasion of Canada has always been in the back of American minds since the beginning of the nation, and with the last American invasion of Canada having resulted in the burning of the White House, it is wise we prepare ourselves for the fight ahead."

 IDA_Operation_Winter_Storm_desc:0 "With our preparations to invade Canada now complete, we can now proceed with our invasion of Canada.

 IDA_War_Plan_Green:0 "War Plan §GGreen§!"
 IDA_War_Plan_Green_desc:0 "Mexico has always been a thorn in America's side. Not just with illegal aliens, but the consistent flow of narcotics and violence has been just one of the many things that lead to the destabilization of America. Now that we've set our sights south of the border, it is only a matter of time until we bring this troublesome state to heel."
 IDA_Operation_Border_Patrol:0 "Operation §GBo§!§Yrde§!§Br P§!§Yatr§!§Gol§!"
 IDA_Operation_Border_Patrol_desc:0 "Under normal circumstances, an invasion of Mexico would be quite difficult. Aside from the threat posed by the Mexican Armed Forces, it was extremely likely that local resistance would make the long term occupation of Mexico untenable. Luckily for us, the recent Mexican Civil War has significantly weakened most of those potential threats, and all we have to do now is sweep up the pieces."
 IDA_War_Plan_Violet:0 "War Plan §pViolet§!"
 IDA_War_Plan_Violet_desc:0 "Quite easily our broadest war plan yet, War Plan Violet covers areas in Central America, South America, and the Caribbean. Given that these areas are relatively distant from us, we should take care not to screw up any invasions we may launch against them."

 IDA_Operation_Just_Cause_II_desc:0 "Unlike its namesake, Operation Just Cause II isn't just the invasion of Panama, but the entire region of Central America.

 IDA_Operation_Dantes_Inferno_desc:0 "Named after the epic poem of the same name, one of Dante's Inferno's most infamous scenes is the last circle of Hell, where traitors are eternally chewed up by the three faces of Lucifer.

 IDA_Protect_Consitutional_Rights_desc:0 "The Constitution is not just the basis of American government, but American life as well; a fact that many Americans have sadly forgotten.

 IDA_Promote_School_Choice:0 "Promote School Choice"
 IDA_Promote_School_Choice_desc:0 "For years, liberals and socialists have used the public school system to brainwash children, and force their beliefs on them.

 IDA_Privatize_Public_Land:0 "Privatize Public Land"
 IDA_Privatize_Public_Land_desc:0 "The battle between private citizens and the federal government over land rights is one that has left a permanent mark on U.S. history. With our very own leader, Ammon Bundy, having been involved in standoffs with the federal government over such issues in the past, it is no surprise that privatizing all this public land is at the top of our agenda."

 IDA_Enshrine_Juedo_Chirstian_Values_desc:0 "America is not just founded on Judeo-Christian values, but its most sacred traditions are as well. This fact has only made it more sad that many god-fearing Christians are forced to hide their beliefs to avoid being prosecuted by an increasingly intolerant society. As such, we must make it clear that such hate won't be tolerated, and that these values are properly recognized and affirmed." 
 IDA_Eliminate_Welfare:0 "Eliminate Welfare"
 IDA_Eliminate_Welfare_desc:0 "The entire concept of welfare is a detriment to free-functioning societies, and is nothing more than a legal way for the government to steal money from Americans as a way to "help the poor."

 IDA_A_Battle_Of_High_Priests_desc:0 "One of the sad realities of our time is knowing just how far our adversaries will go to undermine us, and sadly even our beloved church is not above them. The LDS Church has been infiltrated by a cadre of undesirable fellow, most notably: socialists, globalists and environmentalists. If we are to save our faith, it is vital we cleanse the church of these groups before it is too late."   
 IDA_Work_With_The_Leadership:0 "Work With the Leadership"

 IDA_Return_To_Independence:0 "Return to Independence"
 IDA_Return_To_Independence_desc:0 "Though our faith is now based out west in the Salt Lake Valley, Independence, Missouri continues to hold a significant status in our faith.

 IDA_Mission_To_The_South:0 "Mission to the South"
 IDA_Mission_To_The_South_desc:0 "Despite its incredible size and importance in U.S. history, our influence in the Southern U.S. is incredibly limited. Despite this, the people of the South are as much God's children as we are, and turning our back on them now is nothing short of a crime."   
 IDA_Show_The_Midwest_True_Freedom:0 "Show the Midwest True Freedom"
 IDA_Show_The_Midwest_True_Freedom_desc:0 "Our march eastward isn't solely inspired by our faith, but by our politics as well. Quite particularly, many governments in the Midwest have claimed to be the last bastions of liberty and freedom in America. Though they certainly are close, they are no where near actually embodying such ideals. As such, it is only right we show them what real freedom looks like."
 IDA_Take_Down_The_Tyrants:0 "Take Down the Tyrants"
 IDA_Take_Down_The_Tyrants_desc:0 "The election of Joe Biden is easily one of the biggest catastrophes to have occurred in American history.

 IDA_Assist_The_Missions_In_Canada_desc:0 "Canada is home to hundreds of thousands of fellow believers, and though many in the country thought they could escape the turmoil down south, it was only a matter of time until the Great White North fell apart as well. Since then, many of the faithful have been tossed around from one dictator to another, and now that we are in a position to help, it is vital we head north to assist our brothers and sisters."

 IDA_annex_decision:0 "Annexation of the Western Command Zone"
 IDA_annex_decision_desc:0 "By executive decision, the Western Command Zone has been given autonomy for the time being. Of course, this arrangement isn't meant to be permanent, and either party could choose to end the Western Command Zone at any time."
 IDA_trump_annex_the_wcz:0 "Annex the Western Command Zone"

 # WCZ Capital Change #
 IDA_set_capital:0 "Set a New Capital"
 IDA_set_capital_desc:0 "Though our original capital of Idaho Falls was fitting at the time, our current situation has prompted many to suggest we move our base of operations."   
 IDA_set_capital_idaho_falls:0 "Move the capital to Idaho Falls, Idaho"
 IDA_set_capital_idaho_falls_desc:0 "Proposed as a compromise between the Idaho and Wyoming administrations, our original capital of Idaho Falls leaves much to be desired in terms of its size, and access to the interstate. That said, the city holds a special place in the hearts of many, giving it significant symbolic value."
 IDA_set_capital_boise:0 "Move the capital to Boise, Idaho"
 IDA_set_capital_boise_desc:0 "The capital of Idaho, Boise is a rather logical upgrade from Idaho Falls. Though it falls short when it comes to being connected to the interstates, it's westward location makes it a prime launching point for incursions into Cascadia."
 IDA_set_capital_cheyenne:0 "Move the capital to Cheyenne, Wyoming"
 IDA_set_capital_cheyenne_desc:0 "The capital of Wyoming, Cheyenne is a rather interesting choice to be our capital. Lying along both I-80 and I-25, as well as being located much further east, Cheyenne certainly isn't a bad location. However, given its rather low population, many consider it a much inferior option compared to Denver, or even Albuquerque, both of which can fulfill rather similar roles." 
 IDA_set_capital_missoula:0 "Move the capital to Missoula, Montana"
 IDA_set_capital_missoula_desc:0 "The capital of Montana, Many consider Missoula to be an arguably worse alternative to Boise. With Boise having a higher population, Missoula's only advantage is its close proximity to Canada, something that might prove useful depending on our goals."
 IDA_set_capital_salt_lake_city:0 "Move the capital to Salt Lake City, Utah"
 IDA_set_capital_salt_lake_city_desc:0 "The capital of Utah, Salt Lake City is a surprisingly optimal location to place our capital. Nicknamed the "Crossroads of the West" Salt Lake City sits at the intersection between I-15, I-80, and I-84, with I-70 being close by as well. Though its population leaves a bit to be desired, its large enough to handle most administrative needs." 
 IDA_set_capital_reno:0 "Move the capital to Reno, Nevada"
 IDA_set_capital_reno_desc:0 "A middle ground between Salt Lake City and San Francisco, Reno's main benefit is its close proximity to the Bay Area, and I-5." 
 IDA_set_capital_las_vegas:0 "Move the capital to Las Vegas, Nevada"
 IDA_set_capital_las_vegas_desc:0 "A middle ground between Salt Lake City and Los Angeles, Las Vegas is not a bad location to be a capital. Though it lacks connections to the interstates, it makes up for this shortcoming with its high population and proximity to Salt Lake and Los Angeles."
 IDA_set_capital_phoenix:0 "Move the capital to Phoenix, Arizona"
 IDA_set_capital_phoenix_desc:0 "The capital of Arizona, Phoenix is another prime location for a capital. Being in close proximity to both I-10 and I-40, as well as having an incredibly large population, Arizona has the makings of a great administrative hub."
 IDA_set_capital_denver:0 "Move the capital to Denver, Colorado"
 IDA_set_capital_denver_desc:0 "The capital of Colorado, Denver is easily the prime location to launch offensives into the east. With access to both I-70 and I-80, as well as having a large population to boot, Denver allows for easier access to the eastern U.S."
 IDA_set_capital_albuquerque:0 "Move the capital to Albuquerque, New Mexico"
 IDA_set_capital_albuquerque_desc:0 "Though nearly inferior to Denver in almost every single way, New Mexico does have one advantage, easier access to the South." 
 IDA_set_capital_seattle:0 "Move the capital to Seattle, Washington"
 IDA_set_capital_seattle_desc:0 "Heavily populated and with easy access to I-5 and I-90, Seattle already makes for a decent capital, but there's one large advantage that makes it stand out, it's close proximity to Canada. Having our capital in Seattle would allow us easier access to Canada, should the need for it arise."
 IDA_set_capital_portland:0 "Move the capital to Portland, Oregon"
 IDA_set_capital_portland_desc:0 "A middle ground between Seattle and San Francisco, Portland is a decent capital given its population and connection to I-5 and I-84. Portland's main strategic benefit is it's proximity to California, something that may prove useful is we need it." 
 IDA_set_capital_san_francisco:0 "Move the capital to San Francisco, California"
 IDA_set_capital_san_francisco_desc:0 "With a high population and great access to the interstates, San Francisco is a prime location for a capital, with it's westward location providing extra safety from threats from the east."
 IDA_set_capital_los_angeles:0 "Move the capital to Los Angeles, California"
 IDA_set_capital_los_angeles_desc:0 "Highly populated with great access to the interstates, it should be no surprise that Los Angeles is in consideration for one of our potential capitals."
 IDA_set_capital_anchorage:0 "Move the capital to Anchorage, Alaska"
 IDA_set_capital_anchorage_desc:0 "Anchorage is a rather poor choice for a capital. With it's low population and being disconnected from our major supply hubs, Anchorage's only benefit is its relative safety from attack from land." 
 IDA_set_capital_honolulu:0 "Move the capital to Honolulu, Hawaii"
 IDA_set_capital_honolulu_desc:0 "Easily the most secure option for a capital, the capital of Hawaii is easily the best example of a trade off. It's great distance from the mainland would make operations on the mainland much more difficult. That said, we could easily turn Honolulu into an impenetrable fortress, making it near impervious to invasion."

 # National Spirits #
 IDA_Lawlessness:0 "Rampant Lawlessness"
 IDA_Lawlessness_desc:0 "The sudden withdrawal of Utahn forces left a large power vacuum in our territory. Luckily for us, reestablishing order shouldn't be too hard of a task."
 IDA_Restoring_Order:0 "Restoring Order"
 IDA_Restoring_Order_desc:0 "It is high time we turned our attention to putting down the rampant lawlessness within our borders. Luckily for us, these petty criminals are no match for our troops, and this matter should be dealt with shortly."
 IDA_American_Redoubt:0 "The American Redoubt"
 IDA_American_Redoubt_desc:0 "Proposed by our very own James Wesley, Rawles back in 2011, the American Redoubt was intended to be a safe haven for God-fearing conservatives in the northwestern United States, with the idea being that people would migrate to the area over time. Though we have lost much of the land comprising the borders of the original redoubt, many continue to arrive in our territory under the guise of supporting us."
 IDA_Militia_State_1:0 "Militia State"
 IDA_Militia_State_1_desc:0 "Being a state reliant on militias is a mixed bag. Though we enjoy a network of local connections and great knowledge of local geography, our pilots can't fly anything faster than a propeller plane, our soldiers can't handle most heavy weapon systems properly, and operating a proper tank is a pipe dream. Our forces are thoroughly unprepared to fight a modern war, and the sidelining of military officers has only exacerbated this problem. It will take a monumental effort if we are to build a professional fighting force.\n§T----------------§!\n§YThe state of our army will improve with successful wars against our neighbors, but we can still make efforts to reform our forces in the meantime.§!"
 IDA_Militia_State_2:0 "Militia State - Veterans Promoted"
 IDA_Militia_State_2_desc:0 "Despite our continued trouble with training pilots, the promotion of our veterans to command position has greatly improved the quality of our armed forces. This has come at the cost of taking valuable manpower off the battlefield, but the improved quality of our troops should make up for this.\n§T----------------§!\n§YWe have chosen to sacrifice manpower in exchange for improving the quality of our army. Waging a successful war now, should inspire greater enlistment, and slightly improve the state of our army.§!"
 IDA_Militia_State_3:0 "Militia State - Encouraged Enlistment"
 IDA_Militia_State_3_desc:0 "We have decided to use what little, political will we have to encourage enlistment into our army. Though this doesn't help with the quality of our armed forces, it will help alleviate our dire manpower shortage.\n§T----------------§!\n§YWe have chosen to forgo improving the quality of our army in exchange for alleviating our manpower issues. Waging a successful war now, will return enlistment levels back to normal rates, but greatly improve the state of our army.§!" 
 IDA_Militia_State_4:0 "Militia State - Partially Reformed"
 IDA_Militia_State_4_desc:0 "Our recent victories on the battlefield has greatly improved the state of our armed forces. Despite this, certain issues continue to persist, and it will take a bit more to fully complete our reforms.\n§T----------------§!\n§YThough it appears reforming our air force will take its own dedicated effort, our armed forces only require a bit more experience to successfully reform.§!" 
 IDA_Militia_State_5:0 "Militia State - Near Complete Reform"

 IDA_Army_Of_The_Redoubt_desc:0 "From a ragtag collection of militias to a professional fighting force, our armed forces have proven themselves a worthy foe on the battlefield.

 IDA_Economic_Dependence_1:0 "Dependent Industry"
 IDA_Economic_Dependence_1_desc:0 "The loss of much of our territory in Idaho and Wyoming has also resulted in the loss of our industrial capacity. As of now, we are heavily dependent on supplies from the east to sustain ourselves. We will have to make efforts towards self-sufficiency if we are to succeed in our mission.\n§T----------------§!\n§YOur economic dependence will lessen with the more territory we annex, but we can still promote economic development inside our borders in the meantime." 
 IDA_Economic_Dependence_2:0 "Dependent Industry - Increased Taxation"
 IDA_Economic_Dependence_2_desc:0 "Though it goes against some of our core beliefs, we have had no choice, but to increase taxes in order to fund basic government functions. Though this is incredibly unpopular among our population base, this will give us a bit of breathing room for now.\n§T----------------§!\n§YIncreasing taxation will greatly reduce our consumer goods, but we must look to territorial expansion if we are to solve our economic woes."
 IDA_Economic_Dependence_3:0 "Dependent Industry - Mobilized Economy" #Switches to War Economy
 IDA_Economic_Dependence_3_desc:0 "Though it won't be as immediately effective as increasing taxes, it is much more preferable to mobilize the populous, and our our economy for war. This option is not only more politically viable, but also better for us in the long run.\n§T----------------§!\n§YWe have chosen to further mobilize our economy to make up for our lack of industry. Though this solution will work for now, we must look towards territorial expansion if we are to solve our economic woes."
 IDA_Economic_Dependence_4:0 "Dependent Industry - Conditional Autarky"
 IDA_Economic_Dependence_4_desc:0 "The conquest of new territory, has given us access to a sufficient industrial base. With this, then end pf our economic dependence with the east draws closer. \n§T----------------§!\n§YOur newfound industry is nearly enough to make us self-sufficient. All we have left to do is to finalize our economic reforms."
 IDA_Economic_Miracle:0 "Economic Miracle"

 IDA_Lackluster_Air_Force_2:0 "Improving Force - Air Superiority Focus"
 IDA_Lackluster_Air_Force_2_desc:0 "By focusing on maintaining at least some semblance of air superiority, we can more effectively protect our industry, and our troops, from unwanted air assaults."
 IDA_Lackluster_Air_Force_3:0 "Improving Air Force - Strategic Destruction Focus"

 IDA_Lackluster_Air_Force_4:0 "Improving Air Force - Battlefield Support Focus"

 idaho_rework.55.d:0 "Following our request to have northern Utah returned to us, the Western Command Zone gave us a counter-proposal, to trade Logan and Moffat County for all of our Nevadan territories. This counter-offer is an outrageous demand, considering how much more territory we'd be giving up. Alas, if we wish to resolve this situation peacefully, this may be an offer we just have to take."

That said, we'd still gain control over most of Nevada at little cost to us, and the benefits of resolving this conflict peacefully may outweigh the loss of Clark County."

Now they were a professional army, well versed in the art of modern war, and comparable to their contemporaries. Stankiewicz felt proud, they had come a long way from their militia roots, and they were going to keep moving forward.

This victory has deeply emboldened the Trump administration in their quest to reclaim the U.S., while the Biden administration has remained silent on the matter. The militias are expected to push their expansion westward into the Pacific states, but only time will tell whether they can replicate their success against the Californian juggernaut that awaits them."

The Bundys are arguably the most well connected militia leaders in the entire U.S., and the support they can provide is immeasurable. However, it should be noted that these connections also make them incredibly influential in our political sphere, and there is concern that their loyalty to President Trump is shaky at best.

Generals from the Idaho and Wyoming Army National Guard managed to catch wind of our plans, and have demanded they be reinstated as well. Though our success has drained much of the influence they used to have, their demand isn't entirely useless to us. Unlike most of our commanders, these generals have had years of experience as officers, and were still in active duty when the civil war began, making them some of the best commanders available to us. That said, giving in to their demands like this will make us appear weak, and cost us politically. Should we accept their demands?"

 idaho_rework.77.d:0 "We have received word from the Californian government that they've refused to be annex or offer any direct support to our cause.

The sights of pomp and circumstance have been replaced by celebrations in the streets. From small towns to major metros, Loyalists from all over have gathered to celebrate our victory in the west, and as soldiers return home on leave for the first time in years, the festivities have only heightened.

He reminisced to that time all those years, where he went to take nap, only to be sent on the wildest journey he could have ever imagined. He thought about what his past self would think about all the paperwork in front of him now. Stankiewicz chuckled, either way, countries don't administer themselves do they? As he returned back to his work, his secretary barged in. "Sir, she said in a frantic manner, "Governors Little and Gordon are here to see you."\n\n"Those two?" a confused Stankiewicz replied, "did I have a meeting scheduled with them?\n\n"No sir, they just said they had something important to discuss with you."\n\n"Well, send them in I guess."\n\nThe secretary scurried out of the room, and Stankiewicz went to organize his desk. "What on earth could be so important that they'd come unannounced like this?" Stankiewicz thought to himself. As soon as got cleaning, Governors Brad Little and Mark Gordon walked into the room.\n\n"Good day to you both," Stankiewicz said as he motioned towards the chairs in front of his desk, "please, have a seat."\n\nLittle spoke up as he and Gordon took a seat, "We're doing good Stankiewicz, but let's not waste time on the formalities, we're here to talk to you about the future of this nation."\n\n"The future of this nation?" Stankiewicz replied, "I'm glad for your concern, but fret not, the preparations for our reintegration with the East are going smooth-"\n\nLittle cut in, "Not that, I'm talking about the possibility of independence for our nation."\n\nStankieiwcz sat back in his chair, he couldn't believe what he was hearing. "INDEPENDENCE?!" Stankieiwcz said furiously, "where did you get that idea from?! We were given a mission you know!"\n\n"A mission given by a tyrant," replied Gordon.\n\nStankieiwcz cut in, "A tyrant?! The president is no tyrant! I could have you arrested for tha-"\n\n"Think about it Stankiewicz," Gordon snapped back, "ever since he was elected he's never stood in another election. Even our enemies, the Bidenists, have held regular elections since the start of this war. The president is no defender of democracy."\n\n"Why you! I won't stand for thi-" Stankiewicz paused, Gordon was right, the president had refused to hold elections ever since the civil war began, citing a national emergency as the reason.\n\n"You realize it now, don't you Stankieiwcz?" said Little, "the president has just been using us to further his own goals, he cares little for the traditions were swore to defend."\n\nStankiewicz remained silent in his seat."But we don't have to follow the same path," Gordon began, "the people of the West deserve better, and we can give them better, YOU can give them better. It just can not be with that Caesar in the East. So what do you say Stankiewicz? Can we give the people what they deserve?"\n\nStankiewicz thought hard about the options in front of him. Nearly over a decade ago, he created the Idaho Light Militia to defend against a socialist dictatorship, now he was faced with a whole different monster. After several minutes of silence, Stankiewicz picked up his head, and he said..."

How goes the work?"\n\n"It's going well Mr. President," Stankiewicz replied, "how about you?"\n\nThe once booming voice quieted significantly, "Things could be better, but never mind that, I'm calling you to thank you for your continued loyalty and service to our cause."\n\n"No need for thanks sir," replied Stankiewicz, "I'm just doing my duty."\n\nPresident Trump's voice picked up significantly,  "Everyone says that Stankiewicz, now I'm not calling just to thank you for your service, but to reward you as well."\n\nStankiewicz was taken aback by this statement "A reward sir?" he said intriguingly.\n\n"Yes, a reward," the voice on he other end returned to its booming volume, "you've proven yourself to be far more useful than most of my own staff because of this, I've decided to make your position a little more official..."\n\nStankiewicz was thoroughly intrigued now. "Official sir? How so?"\n\n"Stankiewicz, I'll be giving you a commission as a general in the U.S. Army."\n\n"A general?!" Stankiewicz was shocked at wat he was hearing, "but I've never even served befor-"\n\nThe president quickly cut in, "Stankiewicz, loyalty means a lot to me, and you've proven yours time and time again. Not only that, but your achievements show you are more than qualified for this position. With that said, can I expect your continued service and loyalty to our cause?"\n\n"Yes sir, I won't let you down," replied Stankieiwcz alertly\n\n"Thank you general, now if you'll excuse me I have some other business to attend to." The call ended, and Stankiewicz slumped back into his chair. For years he had been the leader of a small militia group in Northern Idaho, now here he was, a general in the armed forces.

Over a hundred years ago, brave men of the Union fought to free the slaves from bandage and servitude. Now a hundred years later, we had fought to do just the same. To free the Americans from the socialist menace in the West. Just a little while ago, we had though we'd succeeded in our mission, but we were wrong. Those that wish to stomp on the liberties of others continue to exist, and they are closer to us than many of us may think. With such a threat so close to our homes, we have had to make a tough decision, the West must be free to face this threat. Where Lincoln fought to preserve the Union, we shall fight to preserve it as well. Let it be known that the West shall no longer bend over to tyrants!

The winner of the election will be whichever party in the [IDA.GetName] has the highest popularity. A departure from tradition, the party primaries will occur after the election (the president will be decided by the [IDA.GetName] at the end of the election.)\n-------------------------------\nPOLITICAL PARTIES\n\nThere are four political parties participating in the First Lincoln Election: the §RRepublican Party§!, represented by the §RRepublican§! ideology; the §CDemocratic Party§!, represented by the §CDemocrat§! ideology, the §YLibertarian Party§!, represented by the §YLibertarian-Right§! ideology; and the §pConstitution Party§!, represented by the §pAutocrat§! ideology (more specifically, the Fundamentalist sub-ideology.) The Republican party is split between a §Opro-Trump§! and §Ranti-Trump§! faction, and should they win, the [IDA.GetName] will decide which faction will prevail.\n-------------------------------\nEVENTS - EXPLANATION\n\nThere are a potential of 13 events available for the election (one for each state in the Western United States.) The accessibility of events (and subsequently, who gets the events) is determined by several criteria, the most important being whether a certain state is owned by the [IDA.GetName] or any of its allies. If the [IDA.GetName] directly controls a particular state, they will get the election event. If a particular state is controlled by an ally of the [IDA.GetName] and that country is player controlled, they will get the election event.\n-------------------------------\nEVENTS - ORDER AND THEIR REQUIREMENTS\n\nElections in Idaho - Automatically given to the [IDA.GetName]\nElections in Wyoming - Automatically given to the [IDA.GetName]\nElections in Montana - Own State 86 (Helena)\nElections in Utah - Own State 411 (Wastach Front)\nElections in Colorado - Own State 45 (Western Slope)\nElections in Nevada - Own State 46 (Clark County)\nElections in Arizona - Own State 495 (Maricopa County)\nElections in New Mexico - Own State 40 (Navajo)\nElections in Washington - Own State 125 (Greater Seattle Area)\nElections in Oregon - Own State 496 (Portland)\nElections in California - Own State 304 (San Francisco)\nElections is Alaska - Own State 2 (Anchorage)\nElections in Hawaii - Own State 433 (Oahu)"

Even with the large population of Albuquerque being outside of our effective administration, New Mexico remains more liberal than conservative.

 idaho_rework.281.d:0 "A rather unexpected event transpired today, as a delegation from Exiled Trumpists arrived today to offer us an alliance. Though we would have rejected such an offer almost instantaneously in the past, dramatic shifts in their government have made us reconsider this stance. Considering his work on the Supreme Court, Justice Kavanaugh make a very attractive ally both ideologically and politically. That said, his decision to stick with Trump after the start of the civil war has turned off many to the idea of an alliance. How should we respond to their offer?"
 idaho_rework.281.a:0 "New partners in the fight for freedom!"
 idaho_rework.281.b:0 "We'll be better off alone."
 idaho_rework.282.t:0 "The [FROM.GetName] Rejects Our Offer"
 idaho_rework.282.d:0 "Despite our attempts to reach out to the [FROM.GetName] for an alliance, we were met with skepticism and turned down. Though this response was to be expected, it is sad that we'll have to continue on our journey alone." 
 idaho_rework.282.a:0 "You can't win them all."
 idaho_rework.283.t:0 "A Tale of Two Brothers"
 idaho_rework.283.d:0 "As war breaks out between the [IDA.GetName] and the [FLO.GetName], many can not help but notice the particular situation these two states have gotten themselves in. With the two states being lead by Donald Trump Jr. and Barron Trump respectively, many had assumed the two brothers would come to a peaceful resolution, but it seems the two haven't even spoken to each other since Trump's defeat at the hands of Republican dissidents. As observers begin to speculate about the reason for their poor relations, others believe that this conflict truly is, nothing personal."
 idaho_rework.283.a:0 "It's just business."
 idaho_rework.284.t:0 "Saving the West"
 idaho_rework.284.d:0 "Just a short while ago, few could have imagined what we have accomplished, but here we are, standing defiantly against them. However, just holding control over the United States isn't enough. If we are to ensure the continued purity of our nation, we must export our crusade abroad, and where better to start than with the North American continent."

 idaho_rework.285.d:0 "Though are reunification of the United States is something to be celebrated, we can't rest on our heels just yet. Though we may call ourselves an empire, we don't actually have an empire. It is a matter of national pride that we obtain one as soon as possible, and where better to start our legacy than with the North American continent itself?"
 idaho_rework.285.a:0 "Today a country, tomorrow a continent!"
 idaho_rework.286.t:0 "American Hegemony Over North America"
 idaho_rework.286.d:0 "In what many consider a landmark achievement in human history, the entire North American continent has been unified under a single flag. The massive state is arguably one of, if not the, strongest nation in existence, and as many ponder the ramifications of such a powerful state, it can easily be stated that this nation will define human history for the next century." 
 idaho_rework.286.a:0 "Return of the American century."
 idaho_rework.287.t:0 "California Attacks!"
 idaho_rework.287.d:0 "Earlier today troops from the [PRA.GetName] assaulted several positions on our border. Though we expected they'd launch an invasion eventually, this one is way ahead of schedule. We must take action immediately if we are to survive this."   
 idaho_rework.287.a:0 "We need a plan, fast!"
 idaho_rework.287.b:0 "Let's show them what were made of!"
 idaho_rework.288.t:0 "A Doomed War"
 idaho_rework.288.d:0 "With Mike Pence and his allies right on our doorstep, many officials of the Trump administration are scrambling to secure their own futures. Though President Trump is set on defending Denver to the last man, others have begun preparing to flee to the Western Command Zone and set up a government there. Now the question is, will you flee west or fight till the end?"
 idaho_rework.288.a:0 "I'll be back."
 idaho_rework.288.b:0 "LET THEM COME AT ME!"
 idaho_rework.289.t:0 "The [IDA.GetName] Proposes an Alliance"
 idaho_rework.289.d:0 "The recently established [IDA.GetName] has proposed we from an alliance and free America from the clutches of tyranny together. Though this offer is tempting, some are skeptical to the sincerity of this offer. What should we do?"
 idaho_rework.289.a:0 "We shall gladly join them!"

 idaho_rework.290.d:0 "Though we thought the [GLA.GetName] would be obvious allies to our cause, it seems they have rejected us instead. We will have to brave the future ahead of us alone."

 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 DESC_LEADER_JEFF_STANKIEWICZ:0 "Hailing from Priest River, Idaho, Jeffery Stankiewicz was a welder and production supervisor in his professional life. After experiencing a period of unemployment in 2010, Stankiewicz founded the Idaho Light Foot Militia (ILFM) under the justification that Democrats were attempting to install a socialist dictatorship. Though he was reemployed by the start of 2011, Stankiewicz continued to lead, and expand the ILFM, something that would prove vital in the coming decade."      
 DESC_LEADER_GARY_L_SAYLER:0 "Gary L. Sayler has had a rather successful career in the military. Hailing from the U.S. Air Force, Sayler was initially the commander of the 124th Wing at Gowen Field in Boise, Idaho from 1995 to 2004. Sayler would later become the Commander of Idaho's National Air Guard's Joint Force at Gowen Field until 2010 when he was appointed as Idaho's adjutant general, a position he held until 2017." 
 DESC_LEADER_SUSAN_GORE:0 "The daughter of W. L. Gore & Associates co-founder, Wilbert Lee 'Bill' Gore, Susan Gore became infamous for using her family fortune to conduct espionage against political opponents in Wyoming."   
 DESC_LEADER_MELISSA_SUE_ROBINSON:0 "A transgender woman and advocate, Melissa Sue Robinson attempted to run for public office in Nampa, Idaho several times, but has been unsuccessful every single time. She had planned to run in the 2022 Idaho gubernatorial election, but the start of the civil war derailed those plans."
 DESC_LEADER_NATE_MARTIN:0 "Born and raised in Rock Springs, Wyoming, Nate Martin was a writer who worked in the industry for over 15 years. Aside from that, he has been the executive director of the activist group, Better Wyoming since 2017, and served as a trustee on the Albany County School Board."
 DESC_LEADER_JOHN_EARLE_SULLIVAN:0 "If there is one thing that can be said about John Earle Sullivan, it is that he is an extremely militant, black rights activist from Utah. Aside from that, Sullivan has been accused of being both an agent for the left and the right, giving him a rather notorious reputation among the activist community."   
 DESC_LEADER_CHUCK_BALDWIN:0 "Chuck Baldwin is a pastor from Kalispell, Montana, and former chaplain for the Montanan Oath Keepers. Before his move to Montana, Baldwin was the founder, and pastor, of the Crossroad Baptist Church in Pensacola, Florida. From there, Baldwin would have a long history at attempted political campaigns in 2004, 2008, and 2012 for both the Constitution and American Independent Party."
 DESC_LEADER_BRAD_LITTLE:0 "Before becoming governor of Idaho, Brad Little had an extensive dual career as a rancher, and as a politician. As a politician, Little was a state senator who served on several agricultural, environmental, and economic committees, before becoming lieutenant governor of Idaho in 2009, and governor of Idaho in 2019. When the civil war kicked off, Idaho’s poor showing against Montana led to a leadership crisis as lieutenant governor Janice McGeachin attempted to seize power, but this was aborted with the formation of the Western Command Zone.
 DESC_LEADER_MARK_GORDON:0 "Holding a Bachelor of Arts degree in history, Mark Gordon, to say the least, has had a rather lackluster career in politics. After a failed congressional run in 2008, he would eventually be elected as Treasurer of Wyoming, serving from 2012 to 2019. Gordon would assume the office of governor of Wyoming in 2019, and is most notable for having proposed 500 million dollars worth of cuts to Wyoming's budget to account for declining revenues."
 DESC_LEADER_EVAN_MCMULLIN:0 "A CIA officer turned national security advisor, Evan McMullin's claim to fame was his attempted 2016 presidential campaign, where he had hoped to prevent both Hillary Clinton, and Donald Trump from winning the necessary 270 Electoral College votes. Though ultimately unsuccessful, his excellent showing in Utah garnered him significant attention within the state. Since the 2016 election, McMullin has a been a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, and remains devoted to combatting extremism in America."
 DESC_LEADER_BRIAN_BOQUIST:0 "A former lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army, Brian Boquist began his political career in 2004, where he was elected into the Oregon House of Representatives, and from there, he would be elected to the Oregon Senate in 2008. Though his career in Oregon Senate is rather lackluster, his claim to fame is his attempt to block a cap and trade resolution in 2019. With Oregonian law requiring 20 senators to hold a vote, Boquist conspired with his fellow Republicans to walkout of the Senate. When the governor of Oregon threatened to bring them back by force, Boquist implied he wouldn't be going back without a fight." 
 DESC_LEADER_JANICE_MCGEACHIN:0 "A member of the more right-wing faction of the Republican Party, Janice McGeachin has been in politics since 1998, having been a member of the Idaho House of Representatives. As lieutenant governor, McGeachin has been incredibly critical of governor Brad Little, and Idaho’s poor performance against Montana, in the early days of the civil war, led to her attempting to remove Little from power."
 DESC_LEADER_HARRIET_HAGEMAN:0 "Known as the "Wicked Witch of the West" in some circles, Harriet Hageman is a Wyoming lawyer best known for fighting against environmental policies and groups. Her most high profile case was the 2003 ruling of the National Forest Roadless Area Conservation Policy, in which she successfully argued that the policy was illegal." 
 DESC_LEADER_JOE_ARPAIO:0 "Styling himself as "America's Toughest Sheriff," Joe Arpaio was the sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona from 1992 to 2017. Never shying away from the public eye, Arpaio was thrust into the public sphere for his numerous television appearances, however, such infamy would also bring him vast amounts of controversy. Arpaio has been accused of everything from abuse of power to mistreatment of prisoners, eventually being convicted of contempt of court in 2017. This, however, would not last, as he was pardoned by President Donald Trump a month later."
 DESC_LEADER_LARRY_ELDER:0 "Born and raised in Los Angeles, California, Larry Elder is easily one of America's most prominent conservative voices. Though he started off as a attorney, Elder would find his calling in media when he began hosting an evening talk show on KABC radio station in 1994.

 DESC_LEADER_PAULETTE_JORDAN:0 "Born in Idaho and serving in the Coeur d’Alene Tribal Council before her nomination, Jordan has been called the new face of rural politics in America due to her progressive politics and ability to unite Idaho’s Democratic Party in Idaho's gubernatorial election. Although this wasn’t enough to get her into the governor’s seat in her 2018 run, it's managed to secure her an arguably more important position."  
 DESC_LEADER_CHRIS_ROTHFUSS:0 "A senator of the Wyoming State Senate, Chris Rothfuss is a rather obscure figure outside of his home state of Wyoming. Originally a chemical engineer, Rothfuss was elected to the Wyoming State Senate in 2010 and was elevated to the position of Senate Minority Leader in 2013.

 DESC_LEADER_STEVE_SCHMIDT:0 "A veteran political strategist, Steve Schmidt made a name for himself through his work on several, high profile campaigns, namely those of George W. Bush and John McCain. Though he was a committed Repubican, Schmidt would become increasingly critical of his party, mainly due to the actions of the then President Trump.

Eventually, Schmidt would depart from the Republican Party, and later resigned from The Lincoln Project due to allegations of sexual harassment." 
 DESC_LEADER_JAY_INSLEE:0 "Known for being the governor of Washington, Jay Inslee has had a long career in Washington politics. A lawyer by education, Inslee was elected to the Washington House of Representatives in 1989 and would hold various political offices from then up to his election as governor in 2013.

 DESC_LEADER_AMMON_BUNDY:0 "A leading figure in the American militia movement, Ammon Bundy was born, and raised, on his father's ranch in Bunkerville, Nevada before moving out, and having a troubled, professional career in Phoenix, Arizona before eventually settling in Emmett, Idaho.\n\nAway from his personal life, Bundy would truly make a name for himself in 2014, where he helped organize the 2014 Bundy Standoff, where his father clashed with the Bureau of Land Management over grazing rights, eventually prevailing when BLM withdrew from the situation. This success would later prompt him to organize the disastrous 2016 Occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge to protest the treatment of two ranchers convicted of federal land arson. The standoff would end with the death of one militia member, and arrest of all other participants, most of whom would be sentenced and sent to prison for their actions. Bundy, however, would manage to be found not-guilty on all accounts, and later continue to advocate against the government until the start of the 2nd American Civil War.\n\nWhen the civil war began, Bundy would lend his support to his native Idaho against the pro-Biden forces of Montana. Once the dust settled, and a temporary ceasefire was enacted Bundy would remain in the now, newly established Western Command Zone until hearing rumors of a potential LDS coup in the near future. Being a devote member of the LDS Church, Bundy would travel down to Utah, to offer his support to the church in preparation for their potential coup."   
 DESC_LEADER_MARSHALL_BURT:0 "A veteran of the U.S. Maine Corps, Marshall Burt, a Libertarian, was elected to represent Wyoming's 39th district for a short little while before the civil war started.

 DESC_LEADER_DANIEL_COTTAM:0 "A rather obscure figure from Salt Lake City, Utah, Dr. Daniel Cottam was the Libertarian candidate in Utah's 2020 gubernatorial election. Though his interest in public office have given him a little bit of recognition, his real claim to fame is his role in pioneering single anastomosis loop duodenal switch procedure in the United States." 
 DESC_LEADER_PRO_LIFE:0 "An organic farmer from Letha, Idaho, Pro-Life's name is a rather excellent description of both the man and his beliefs. Born Marvin Richardson Thomas in 1941, Richardson would be raised in a devout LDS family, eventually serving a mission from 1962 to 1964. He would, however, leave the church in 1998, finding the church's stance on fetal personhood to be insufficient. His extreme devotion to combating abortion would lead him to run (unsuccessfully) for office several times, eventually leading to his name change to Pro-Life in 2006. Since then, Pro-Life has continued to run for office in his home state of Idaho ever since."
 DESC_LEADER_REX_RAMMELL:0 "A veterinarian currently residing in Torrington, Wyoming, Rex Rammell is best known for his attempts to run for office in both Idaho and Wyoming. Aside from his unsuccessful political endeavors, Rammell has had a long history of legal issues, usually revolving around illegal hunting and other wildlife issues."
 DESC_LEADER_SCOTT_BRADLEY:0 "Holding a Ph.D. in Consitutional Law, Scott Bradley is rather obscure figure outside his home state of Utah.

In 2017 Trump Jr. and his brother Eric would oversee the Organization while their father assumed the presidency, along with that, Trump Jr. would also become a figurehead within the Republican Party, actively campaigning for several of it's candidates.\n\nWhen the civil war started, Trump Jr. would follow his father to Denver and eventually taking a leading role within his administration."
 DESC_LEADER_GAVIN_MCINNES:0 "Born in England and raised in Canada, Gavin McInnes is a man who's rather lackluster notoriety does not match his achievements. Namely McInnes is responsible for the founding of two major organizations, the media conglomerate Vice in 1994 (which he left in 2008) and the Proud Boys in 2016. It is the founding of the latter, combined with his advocacy of far-right politics, that gained him his reputation.\n\nWhen the civil war started, McInnes would find himself within pro-Trump territory after being expelled from his home in Larchmont, New York. Despite not being an American citizen, McInnnes would successfully find himself rising to a high position within the Trump administration thanks to his influence within the Proud Boys."
 DESC_LEADER_BRETT_KAVANAUGH:0 "Best known for being a Justice of the Supreme Court, Kavanaugh began his career in 1990 after graduating from Yale Law School.

 DESC_GENERAL_ERIC_PARKER:0 "Making a name for himself as the "Bundy Ranch Sniper," Eric Parker could be considered one of the more "inexperienced" commanders of the Western Command Zone due to being an electrician by trade, as well as having no experience in military or law enforcement. In 2018, Parker split the 'Real 3%ers of Idaho' off from the main Idaho branch of the 3%ers, and ran an unsuccessful campaign to become an Idaho state senator in 2020."
