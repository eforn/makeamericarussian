 The_Border_Guard:0 "Border Patrol Supremacy"
 The_Border_Guard_desc:0 "The Border Patrol has taken complete control of the area. Our boys and green march up and down the border looking out for intruders as well as up and down the streets to secure order. Our state’s sole purpose is to protect our fallen country from radicals from the south coming in. Glory for the defense of our border!"
 Crush_The_Immigrant_State:0 "Crush the Damn Immigrants"
 Crush_The_Immigrant_State_desc:0 "They come for our border like vultures to a corpse. We must defeat any illegal invaders at all costs.

 Deport_captured_Soldiers:0 "Deport Captured Soldiers"
 Deport_captured_Soldiers_desc:0 "We have captured a lot of soldiers throughout our conquest and our great leader has come up with a solution.

If you aimed your gun at our head or our mouth, we will personally send you south!"
 Propaganda_Against_Socialism:0 "Anti-Leftist Propaganda"
 Propaganda_Against_Socialism_desc:0 "Almost as bad as illegals, Communists are all around us and need to be stopped.

 Ban_Socialist_sympathizers:0 "Ban Socialist Sympathizers"
 Ban_Socialist_sympathizers_desc:0 "By order of the Border Patrol, any registered socialist, communist, liberal or proggressive by voter registration are banned from voting or public office. All political parties deemed communistic shall be banned and their leaders put on house arrest."

 Reopen_HUAC_desc:0 "Joseph McCarthy embodies American values and is seen as perhaps one of the biggest political heroes since Andrew Jackson. We will do everything we can to forge a nation that exemplifies his values and teachings. Here's to you, the only Joe we will ever take orders from!"
 Ban_Schoolbooks:0 "Ban Socialist Books"
 Ban_Schoolbooks_desc:0 "The Communist Manifesto, The Bread Book, Fifty Shades of Grey, Immigration book guides in Spanish, are all socialist literature.

 No_More_Back_Talk:0 "No More Back Talk"
 No_More_Back_Talk_desc:0 "A lot of so-called politicians criticize us for allegedly committing human rights. Well to them we say that these people abandoned their rights the moment they step foot on American soil. We will intimidate them with Border Patrol guards armed with rifles in every legislative meeting."
 Pack_the_State_Senate:0 "Pack the Senate"
 Pack_the_State_Senate_desc:0 "We will have the Border Patrol endorse all allies on the ballot and see that certain people running for the senate are “encouraged” to drop out of the race. If we have the Senate on our side we can do anything we want!"
 Build_the_wall:0 "Build the Wall"
 Build_the_wall_desc:0 "Donald Trump promised us a wall and we will finish what he started. While we cannot get Mexico to pay for it, we will be able to on our own create a massive wall. A big, beautiful wall with turrets, guard towers, land mines and everything we need to secure our border. Let us put that Chinese “great wall” to shame and build something that could stop an army!"
 Reenact_Immigration_Act_of_1882:0 "Reenact the Immigration Act of 1882"
 Reenact_Immigration_Act_of_1882_desc:0 "An old immigration act from 1882 taxed immigration. We have no idea why we got rid of that but that is fucking genius. By executive order, this act will be reinstated. If anyone wants to enter this country both illegally or legally they will have to pay a hefty fine. Of course back then it was fifty cents so lets make it something more reasonable like a few thousand dollars… per month."
 Pass_War_powers_Act:0 "Reenact War Powers Act"
 Pass_War_powers_Act_desc:0 "The War Powers Act allows the president to step over Congress to get shit done in war. That. Is. Awesome!

Any current member of either who does not fit that bill are asked to resign immediately."
 Crackdown_on_the_Illegals:0 "Enslave Illegals"
 Crackdown_on_the_Illegals_desc:0 "We have a temporary solution to both the wall as well as the illegals. They came here for work so let us give it to them. As they await to be deported they can apply for a 6 month laborer residency. Any able bodied illegal immigrant above the age of 15 can be drafted into the Border Patrol as a laborer. In exchange for staying here for 6 months and a shared housing unit they will work on the border wall or other public service projects. Critics call this slavery, we call it ingenuity."

They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists'' - Donald Trump. That quote is what inspired many of our brave men to join our force. We will enact a rule to create a separation between illegals and citizens. The constitution and all of its rights and freedoms only apply to the citizens of this great country. If you are not a citizen then the constitution, and subsequently rights, do not apply to you."

 Purchase_North_Arizona:0 "Purchase the North"
 Purchase_North_Arizona_desc:0 "Perhaps a peaceful option is possible by regaining the northern parts of Arizona through purchasing the land rather than invading it.

 Take_Northern_Arizona:0 "Take the North"

 Arizona_Arms_Factory:0 "Build up factories!"
 Arizona_Arms_Factory_desc:0 "We can’t prepare a military to defend ourselves without factories to supply our troops with arms and equipment. We must rebuild our factories to support future military endeavors, including the defense of Arizona."

We must liberate the rest of New Mexico and bring them under us, to ensure peace and prosperity for their people. The Amerikareich wants to genocide them, and the Texans and Natives aren’t fit to rule them. We will liberate them."
