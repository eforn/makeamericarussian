 battleship_1_desc:0 "The battleship was once the symbol of the navy and the powerful presence that no one could ever see. With the advent of the anti-ship missiles, the battleship is no longer being built, but everyone still remembers the mighty powers of the battleship."

 battleship_4_desc:0 "The battleship was once the symbol of the navy and the powerful presence that no one could ever see. With the advent of the anti-ship missiles, the battleship is no longer being built.\nBut electromagnetic railguns, which are fired by accelerating shells using electromagnetic induction, can be reasonably mounted on heavy battleships with nuclear reactors because of their size and huge electric power consumption. And this may be the future of our navy."

 carrier_1_desc:0 "Many military theorists believe there is no ships can beat the modern carrier fleet. Without enough screening ships, however, anti-ship missiles from ships smaller than aircraft carriers would pose a major threat."

 carrier_3_desc:0 "It's difficult to keep a huge aircraft carrier from being detected by radar, but you can paint it with radar-proof paint that can trick it to look at least small."
