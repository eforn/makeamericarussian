 GOOD_FRIDAY_CEASEFIRE_NAME:0 "Good Friday Armistice"
 GOOD_FRIDAY_CEASEFIRE_DESC:0 "Civil War has broken out in the United States! After both Donald Trump and Joe Biden claimed victory in the 2020 Presidential Election, rival governments were formed which inevitably broke out into Civil War in January 2021. Seizing their best chance to reach power, various other groups also rose up throughout the nation.\nFollowing the Chaos of the First Three Months, a temporary ceasefire has finally been signed on Good Friday. But everyone knows it is not to last."
 
 THUNDERS_MUTTER_NAME:0 "The Thunders Mutter"
 THUNDERS_MUTTER_DESC:0 "In the land where cotton was once king, a great trial awaits the people of the South. When Kanye West and his broad coalition of dissidents seized control over the majority of the land of the Old Confederacy, it changed the area forever. Now, however, President West and his allies must fight to keep their fledgling state in tact, while their neighbours scheme and plot their own machinations.\nIn the distance, we hear the thunders muttering. Will they bring chaos or opportunity?"

 WEST_COAST_WARS_NAME:0 "West Coast Wars"
 WEST_COAST_WARS_DESC:0 "Pandamonium in the West! As it became increasingly clear this most uncivil of wars was not going to be a quick affair, the people of the West Coast became increasingly concerned. As D.C.'s influence fell, and Beijing's grew, it became but a matter of time until the Pacific broke off from the Federal Government and declared their own provisional 'People's Republic'. In the process, they alienated a large portion of their support, resulting in the Cascadian Revolution and the Pacific Mutiny. What will become of the West?"

 #Florida
 FLO_GOOD_FRIDAY_DESC:0 "Following the Chaos of the First Months, Floridian Trumpists found themselves completely cut off from the rest of the Loyalists, thanks to the betrayal of Kanye and the Confederacy.\nEric Trump, who found himself trapped in the peninsula along with several others, was assigned as the Provisional leader of Florida by Donald. However, Just before the ceasefire was signed, Eric was assassinated by an assailant with unknown motivations. The military junta promptly put his younger brother, Barron, in charge, believing they could control him. They are wrong."
 #Texas
 TEX_GOOD_FRIDAY_DESC:0 "Don't mess with Texas! Following the outbreak of Civil War, Senator Ted Cruz was quick to mobilise and assert control over the country. Through the proclamation of neutrality, a move which has him acclaimed by some and demonised by others, Texas was largely spared the fires of war. National guard troops seized areas of New Mexico, Oklahoma and Louisiana to avoid any fighting from spilling into Texas proper, but the Lone Star State has been otherwise untouched. With the ceasefire, it is beginning to set in that this war won't be over any time soon. Many clamour for political reform, and a proper Texan constitution."
 #Maine
 NEW_GOOD_FRIDAY_DESC:0 "Following the beginning of the Second American Civil War, many republican media elements fled to Northern Maine, mainly to distract Bidenist forces from focusing completely on Trump and to have an easy escape if the Bidenist forces actually came after them. After the Good Friday Ceasefire was signed however, Northern Maine was still under the control of the ragtag group of journalists, media moguls, Conservative talking heads, Conspiracy theorists, and many other misfits. \n\nWith war on the horizon, Maine stands on the brink of becoming a warzone."
 #Montana
 MON_GOOD_FRIDAY_DESC:0 "Announcing its provisional independence as the nation fell into chaos, the State of Montana was mostly unaware of the situation behind closed doors. No one could have ever expected the collapse of the United States, and while shell-shocked local authorities heard no ambiguous instructions from fighting rival governments, the last governor Stephen Bullock has enacted emergency powers and entrenched the rule of the Independent Provisional Democratic Party of Montana. While being prepared for the worst to come, Montana was never prepared to shape its own independent destiny, which lays down in its hands."
 #American Free State
 AFS_GOOD_FRIDAY_DESC:0 "Following the Chaos of the First Months, and the establishment of a Pro-Trump Libertarian authority in the Rust Belt; a faction led by Vermin Supreme, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and James Mattis broke away from Jo Jorgensen’s G.L.A.R., successfully leading a revolt and declaring the new ‘American Free State,’ capturing the entire South-East Rust Belt before the Good Friday Ceasefire.\nNow, however, the Free State is in dire straits. AOC sneers at Supreme's more libertarian ideals as she organizes her Green Army, while Mattis becomes more and more disillusioned with civilian government each day."
 #IDA
 IDA_GOOD_FRIDAY_DESC:0 "God Save President Trump! Having been carved out of Utah's northern territories weeks after the ceasfire, the Western Command Zone is a militia state established by Trump with two goals in mind: to reunify the Western United States, and curb Utahn autonomy. Due to the unique situation of our creation, the Western Command Zone has several issues it must deal with, including but not limited to: rampant lawlessness, an inadequate fighting force, and a heavy reliance on support from the east. If we are to accomplish our goals, these issues must be dealt in a timely manner, and if nothing goes awry, we might just be able to complete our mission." 
 #HOP
 HOP_GOOD_FRIDAY_DESC:0 "The Hopi Tribe is in dire straits. When the Navajo and the Tohono agreed to take provisional control of the former state of New Mexico as the White Man's Government dissolved and dissappaited to Civil War, the Hopi migrated North to avoid the encirclement and possible destruction by the Navajo, hoping to start their own venture. However, such a small tribe controlling such vast land has proven... troublesome. There are many concerns that outside powers may attack, and certain groups could easily take advantage of the Hopi's poor position...\n\nThe Hopi experiment is surely not to last."
 #CAS
 CAS_GOOD_FRIDAY_DESC:0 "Cascadia, Awake! When the vile communists in San Francisco decided they would betray the Legitimate President, we had finally had enough! Not just of them, but of America as a whole. Cascadia shall be free! We will fight for our independence, now and when the Civil War is over!\n\nHowever, it must be said, Cascadia is in a... troublesome position right now. In order to fully secure our independence, we have had to enlist the support of some rather unsavoury elements. We had to in order to survive! Hopefully they won't cause us any more trouble later down the line..."
 #MOL
 MOL_GOOD_FRIDAY_DESC:0 "Molossia is a bizarre nation. It was originally a 'Micronation'- it was practically a joke, a man and his family who dressed up in funny clothes and pretended to be their own country. But when the Civil War broke out, something bizarre happened. A Vacuum of authority, between Utah and the People's Republic, located almost exactly where this micronation stood. To survive, a council of Free Towns was forged between the settlements that stood here. Kevin Baugh, President of 'Molossia', took up the torch of this coalition, and turned Molossia into a real, breathing country, complete with its own economy and army!"
 #PAC
 PAC_GOOD_FRIDAY_DESC:0 "For many within the army, siding with the West Coast Bidenists was... difficult. Many secretly still held loyalties to Trump, and many more still had become disillusioned with democracy completely. Regardless, they would side with the West Coast Bidenists. Until the People's Republic was declared. This abomination on American soil, this Bolshevik Chinese Puppet, was the straw that broke the camel's back. As the Pacific Fleet could no longer support this Communistic Construct, they declared full mutinity and seized Alaska and Hawaii. America may burn, but we'll be damned if it's some no good commies that are behind it!"
 #PRA
 PRA_GOOD_FRIDAY_DESC:0 "Since the annexation of the Californian territory into the American realm, California has been ahead of the American curve... Today is no different. \n\n The Bidenists, who were once in control of both the East and West coast, have been replaced by the government that is now the American People's Republic. After the assassination attempt by Trump extremists, Former Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders fled to California and proclaimed the head of the P.R.A, and as its reluctant head, he leads the largest coalition of Progressives, Liberals, Democratic Socialists, Communists and Anarchists on American soil."
 #USA
 USA_GOOD_FRIDAY_DESC:0 "For the past 4 years, the Trump administration has only worked to Make America Great Again, but at every turn, have been hampered by the Democrats. When Trump ran during the 2020 Election, he promised to never concede to the psuedo-Communistic administration that Biden would bring to America. But although Trump knew he won, Biden and the Mainstream Media claimed that Sleepy Joe had won. What followed could only be described as Chaos... \n\nBiden attempted a coup on January 20th, but as the Secret Service entered to remove Trump, the true Americans amongst them sided with the President and evacuated him to Denver."
 #FRA
 FRA_GOOD_FRIDAY_DESC:0 "Ever since Obama passed the Office of President to Trump, America has been disgraced. Biden, although he had his faults, was undoubtedly better than Trump and when he ultimately won the election, Trump refused to concede. His inability to accept that he lost caused the American Civil War. \n\nThe Bidenist forces, after being pushed out of California and relegated to the East Coast, are strong, but not strong enough to fight all of America... The Good Friday Peace Accords helped stop the American bloodshed, but when the Bidenist forces move to restore the legitimate government, only then will America TRULY be saved."
 #UTA
 UTA_GOOD_FRIDAY_DESC:0 "The State of Utah is in troubled waters. Following the outbreak of civil war, Utah declared loyalty for President Trump and mobilised its national guard to secure its borders as well as strategic regions in neighbouring states. However, it now faces a grave dilemma. With the treacherous People's Republic to the West and Trump tied up in the National Protection War to the East, the Church of Latter Day Saints is becoming increasingly politicised and radical.\n\nFurthermore, a plurality of warlords all around eye Utah's thinly lined defences with greedy eyes. What will become of the Beehive State?"
 #SIN
 SIN_GOOD_FRIDAY_DESC:0 "Following the outbreak of the civil war, the guards at Florence ADMAX, one of the world's highest security prisons, abandonded their posts to fight in the various fronts that consumed America. This was not a wise decision. Now free and lose, Joaqium "El Chapo" Guzman rules his own private Bandit Kingdom in the Rockies. However, knowing this cannot last forever and seeking longevity, Guzman seeks to legitimise his kingdom with a civilian government- he just needs an ideological framework to base it upon.\n\nThat Kazcynski fellow seems to have some bright ideas..."
 #LIB
 LIB_GOOD_FRIDAY_DESC:0 "State Senator Matt Shea had been predicting for years the situation that everyone in America now found themselves in. And he wasn't going to lose the opportunity that God has presented him. Gathering his followers, and utlising the chaos of the Cascadian War of Independence, he fulfilled his dream of creating a Seccessionist West Washington state- the State of Liberty. However, his support is slim and his ambition is only outweighed by his incompetency to rule. Surely Liberty is bound to fall."
 #AFO
 AFO_GOOD_FRIDAY_DESC:0 "Area 51. The Blacksite. The Shadow State. Research has not only continued in the chaos of civil war- it has intensified. What bizarre and cruel things take place behind the walls of Area 51?\n\n\nAnd where do their loyalties truly lie? Certainly not with Salt Lake City. Certainly not with Denver."
 #NPA
 NPA_GOOD_FRIDAY_DESC:0 "Following the January 6th instruction, Mike Pence, Vice President to Donald Trump was reluctant to follow in thje wake of a man who sparked the second American Civil War. Pence had always been the more classiv republican, drawing many Chrisian and typical conservatives to his cause. Paried with Trump, the GOP believed they could reach every single demographic of their voter population. This all went well up until this point. Pence could take no more. In the shadows he slowly rallied support in his home state of Indiana and shortly before the Good Friday ceasefire, he launched his coup. Time will only tell if this American Brutus will survive."
 #NAV
 NAV_GOOD_FRIDAY_DESC:0 "Shortly after the major parts of the United States began to fragment, the South-West underwent its own changes. Far from the reaches of Bernie to the West and disconnect from Denver and Trump in the East, many Native American Nations stook their claims in the desert. The nations of the Navajo, Tohono and Hopi arose and quickly developed a mutual understanding with the others. However, rumors have started to swirl out of the Hopi's lands. Some say that the nation will be brought down from the inside." 
 #TOH
 TOH_GOOD_FRIDAY_DESC:0 "Shortly after the major parts of the United States began to fragment, the South-West underwent its own changes.

 #CSA
 CSA_GOOD_FRIDAY_DESC:0 "Kanye West was placed in charge of the Southern region of the United States by Donald Trump on the onset of the January 6th aftermath. Trump hoped that the popularity of West would draw the south closer together and closer to his cause by proxy. He was wrong. Not even a month into Kanye's control the South was up in flames. Hate groups that had been dormant for generations now reared their ugly heads at each other, devastating the area. To make matters worse, Kanye decided to use this instability to declare his own state; "The Second Confederacy." Even if he has power now, West is sure to encounter trials ahead."
 #VIR
 VIR_GOOD_FRIDAY_DESC:0 "The East Coast was entirly controlled by Biden following the January 6th insurrection which included Virginia, which ended up being the most problomatic state. Virginia had a large republican population and was not so keen in remaining under the control of Biden's goverment. Wanting to maintain control of the region better, Biden dispatched Ralph Northam to directly control the state as a protectorate to Biden's America. Northam has so far been unable to quell the rebellion and full fleged violence has broken out across the state. Many are calling for his disposal in favor of Hunter Biden. Virginia is the worst it has ever been."
 #KFC
 KFC_GOOD_FRIDAY_DESC:0 "When the mining corporations siezed control of West Virginia, their large worker populace needed ample food sources to operate. The corporations turned to nearby Kentucky for this, buying endless amounts of food from the world famous Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise. This came with a caviat. The CEO of KFC, refered now as "The Mad Colonel," demanded that West Virginia support him and his plans to coup the local goverment. After some planning and funding, The Mad Colonel got his way. Nearly the entire state of Kentucky is under his rule and only time will tell what horrible, deep fried nightmares he will create..."
