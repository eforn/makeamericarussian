 #EVENTS
 virginia.1.t:0 "Like Father, Like Son"
 virginia.1.d:0 "Hunter wiped the sweat from his brow as he sat in the waiting room. He had no idea as to why his father had called him to his office, but he was almost certain he wasn't going to like it. His arms began to itch. Before long, it felt like a swarm of fireants had taken over his body. But in the room full of military men and seasoned beaurocrats, he didn't dare give off just how badly his addiction was afflicting him. Nobody could know, least of all his father. So he just wiped the sweat from his forehead a second time.\n\nThe door opened. 'Come in, son.'. Whatever he was about to be told, he hoped it could be short so he could remedy his withdrawal symptoms.\n\n"Now, son, you know I love ya, and you know I've let you off from a lot, which is why I now think it's time you pay me back.". God, what does the old man want now? Some publicity trip? A speech? Looks like I was worried about nothing. "Northam's a great governor, but the Civil War has taken its toll on him. I'm not sure how long he's going to hold out. So I see an opportunity here. The Soul of America rests on me- and as my son, it rests on you. So I'm sending you to Virginia.". What?! Has he finally lost it? Why the fuck would he put me in charge of that frontline rural shithole?\n"Dad--"\n"Now I won't hear any objections from you, sonny, this will be a great experience for you, experience I think you'll find you'll need in the near future. Kiddo...""
 virginia.1.a:0 "...You'll be a leader, or you won't be at all!"
 virginia.3.t:0 "Revolt in the Mountains"
 virginia.3.d:0 "Although we have attempted to crackdown on all political discourse against the Bidenist regime, it seems that Former Governor Robert McDonnell has attempted to rally Republicans, Nazis, and Libertarians in the Mountains of Virginia to fight against our government. Although this revolt is doomed to fail, we must dislodge them from the Mountains of Virginia before we can do any real changes to the Virginian Government. \n\nWith this news coming in, there has also been a declaration of Neutrality from the Nags Head region... But we shall deal with them soon enough"
 virginia.3.a:0 "For Virginia! For Democracy!"
 virginia.4.t:0 "Republican Revolution"
 virginia.4.d:0 "With our success in unifying the many groups who are against Hunter Biden and his Crackfederacy, we can finally prove to the fuckers in D.C. that Virginia is not theirs to control... That Virginia, God Willing, shall smite those who dare to take it's beautiful land and use it to peddle drugs or fight against the Conservative beliefs that have been a building block for Virginia since the Jamestown colony."
 virginia.4.a:0 "For God and Virginia!"
 virginia.5.t:0 "The King of Virginia"
 virginia.5.d:0 "With Virginia finally united, our destiny is clear... Virginia needs a monarch to rule its lands to prevent the election of any Democrats who may want to harm the God-Fearing people of Virginia. \n\nMcDonnell, accepting his role as a transition figure has announced that he shall resign following the choice of the King of Virginia. \nVirginian history is rich with noteworthy figures, so the choices for King are obvious to the outside world. \nWe could grant Robert E. Lee V the crown, as he is not only a descendent of the famed Virginian General, Robert E. Lee but also a descendent of George Washington through George Washington Parke Custis. \nMany in Virginia also support the elevation of Lawrence Shaffner to King of Virginia, as he is related to George Washington through his nephew, Bushrod Washington, and would have been the owner of the Mount Vernon Estate if it had not been sold. These men are descendants of people who helped shape Virginia into what it is today, but there is one more choice for Virginia... \nMalcolm Murray, The 14th Earl of Dunmore, descendent of John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore, and the last British colonial governor of Virginia."
