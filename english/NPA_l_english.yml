They are not Republicans. You can find real American patriots, real Republicans in the [NPA.GetName]. It's the only legal Republican party, and the true predecessor of the GOP.'' - said [FRA.GetLeader] at the end of the debate. \n\nThough the most ardent supporters of Trump were not impressed by the speech, it gave great feeling of superiority to the people of [NPA.GetName].

npa.17.a:0 "Damnit!"
npa.18.t:0 "We Are Going To Be Partitioned!"
npa.18.d:0 "We ignored all the signs.

However seeing that [NPA.GetName] eliminated the loyalist cause, [NPA.GetLeder] reached out to us about the idea of reunifying our nation. \n\nWe would return to our old system of government with free and fair elections, we would work together with the [FRA.GetName] administration and most importantly, we would have all Americans rally around our star spangled banner. It does not matter our beliefs, Republican, Democrat or whatever - all that matters is that we in the [NPA.GetName] and the [FRA.GetName] are Americans, and will do everything in our power to reunify this great country. \n\nShall we go through with this great endeavor?"

When all 50 states are brought back into the fold, we shall have New Democratic elections that will be open and fair. \n\nAcross the country you could hear fireworks, laughing, parades and music as citizens rejoiced for reunification. It does not matter who they voted for, who the fought for or where they are from, today everyone is a patriot and today everyone is an American. People would now look at the American flag and think not of the brutal war that divided them? But they see it as for what it once was, a symbol of democracy and hope. \n\nHope is not something that was common with the collapse, but as the new government was sworn in and the US constitution was reformed, hope was the one word to describe the atmosphere of the country."
npa.22.a:0 "God Bless the United States of America!"
npa.23.t:0 "Unification Has Failed"

npa.24.t:0 "The Rebirth of America!"
npa.24.d:0 "Following successful talks between the [FRA.GetName] and the [NPA.GetName], an agreement to reform the United States has come into effect. For the first time since the civil war, a legitimate government made up of both Republicans and Democrats alike has been created. Promising the restoration of free and fair elections, as well as a plan to reunify the rest of the core territory of the United States, the legitimized government has merged with the [NPA.GetName]. \n\nToday is a great day for Americans, as well  as the rest of the free world."

npa.25.t:0 "Unification talks fail"
npa.25.d:0 "With the [NPA.GetName] toppling the Trump Regime, there were several movements to unify with the [FRA.GetName] to reform the government of the United States of America. But for various reasons both partisan and non-partisan, talks of peaceful unification have failed. \n\nMany are saying that this is a sign that if the country were to ever reunify under any government it would not be by peace talks, but it would be reunified through blood."

npa.26.t:0 "Dissidents Arrested and Exiled"

As we expected, there weren't many citizens that are against us, and had not left our territories. \n\nSome politicians from the old GOP party were locked up, but doesn't pose any threat anymore.

As a result of our action, the final bastion of the opposition, Valparaiso University was closed, all free-thinking idiots taken in custody. Some of the colleges and institutes refused to elaborate, moving out of our nation."
npa.27.a:0 "Damn Academics"
npa.28.t:0 "Hours of Chaos"
npa.28.d:0 "We started the action ''In God We Trust''. It ignited some uprisings we've succesfully taken down. The public opinion, criticising our actions had to be taken down too, just like the rest of the opposition. \n\nRemnants of the old GOP party politicians fled to neighbouring states, some of them were shot trying. As a result of our action, the final bastion of the opposition, Valparaiso University was raided, and bombed to the ground. All the other independent colleges and institutes were raided, because as expected, these were the main sources of social dissent."
npa.28.a:0 "It could be way worse..."
npa.29.t:0 "Valparaiso Uprising!"
npa.29.d:0 "The thought of destroying the opposition was a mistake. A tragic mistake. Our police and army was outnumbered, and eventually defected. Former GOP politicians joined the new movement, called the Revolution Against Tyrrany. \n\nThe civil war has broke out, by some named the continuation of the American war against wannabe-Trumpite tyrrany. Head of the Valparaiso University - university known of its fondness to Marxism, became the leader of the Red Rebellion - union of people that want to put an end to the fascist tyrrany in US of A."

The words were quite strong for an old man who had recently retired. Some people openly miss the old Pence we are now trying to silence using all the necessary measures.\n\nIt is clear that Pence won't cope with us. However, we have a way to change it, using the argument of violence. If we decide to make him a figurehead, Pence will be put in his house arrest, and his family will be taken as hostages - we'll be able to control him - and so the crowds will be satisfied. We may also symbolically kill him, as he's the last symbol of the Old Nation, and the only obstacle that stands in our way to the ultimate power."

Almost every single citizen of ours agrees that Pence should be America's ''New Caesar''. Pence himself is a little confused with the idea, but seeing the overwhelming support for it, agrees to become the absolutist GOP party and people want him to be.\n\nThe question remains whether it should be a strong, autocratic presidency or a literal "coronation" of the Pence as Emperor. Although more serious and older people prefer his dictatorial presidency, the youth would like to see Mike Pence as the actual crowned Emperor with the new name - Pencus Maximus."

We watched with curiosity the glorious victory of Pence's people that promised to restored peace in this part of the states. \n\nNo longer we need to fight for the justice, no longer we have reasons to stay separated. Our people say it would be best to join fresh [NPA.GetLeader]'s [NPA.GetName], putting an end to the self-proclaimed [ROOT.GetName]."
npa.33.a:0 "Time to join forces with [NPA.GetLeader]. We've got America to save."
npa.33.b:0 "We have unfinished business here."
npa.34.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] joins our nation"
npa.34.d:0 "According to the information given by [FROM.GetLeader], [FROM.GetName] recognises us as legitimate regional government with good chances to reunite old USA. After the defeat of Trump, we've proven our worth and that we are capable of protecting Americans from rogue powers. \n\n [FROM.GetLeader] has been given a governor chair, and welcomed in UN of A."
npa.34.a:0 "Great news!"
npa.35.t:0 "Garfield series revived!"
npa.35.d:0 "Nobody would have expected the NPA front plunged in war to revive Garfield series in a middle of a war. The revival met with great American approval, as well as international reviews, describing the new series as a "masterpiece" forged in the face of the terrible conflict in which the United States is plunged. In Trump's America, the episodes were censored, but most other states chose to air them, making virtually all of America now condemning Trump's warfare. \n\n New episodes show Garfield as a "lazy patriot", tirelessly resisting absurd war acts of the narcissistic villain Drumpf von Golden Dump. The creators announce a continuation as long as the issue is possible, and as long as only ''real Drumpf'' troops won't enter Indiana."
npa.35.a:0 "Garfield was a real patriot all the time"
npa.36.t:0 "Incredible success of Garfield series"
npa.36.d:0 "Our results have exceeded expectations... The new Garfield series has become the main cartoon watched in the American States plunged in war. International companies enter into contracts with us, offering us help to ensure that the last center of American culture survives. Even some Californian producers moved to Indianapolis elite district called now "New Hollywood".  \n\n If we manage to win the war, with new contracts, millionaires and companies, Indianapolis could become the capital of the new American cinematography."
