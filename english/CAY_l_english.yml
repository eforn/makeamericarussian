 POLITICS_KENNETH_DART_DESC:0 "Kenneth Dart at one point was the richest man in Michigan until he voided his US citizenship and became a permanent resident of The Cayman Islands to avoid any and all taxes. Inheriting his father's business the Dart Container Corporation, Kenneth Dart has become the most successful billionaire you've never heard of. While his foam cup company outproduces all of its competitors in the world combined, quietly and away from public eyes Kenneth Dart had been purchasing land all over the Grand Cayman island until he virtually owned it all. When the chaos of the American Civil War came, Dart's complete acquisition of the island has so far gone unnoticed..."

 cayman.1.d:0 "In a surprising move by billionaire owner of Virgin Ltd., Richard Branson we have been given an offer to sell off our assets and investments of our island. With Virgin's space port and hyperloop track in California and Nevada being inoperable due to the Second American Civil War he is clearly in need of new land and will go to extremes to make this deal. Branson, a resident of the Virgin Island (yes really) has a variety of connections in the British Overseas Territories which he will use against us. How should we respond to him?"
 cayman.2.d:0 "Richard Branson since 1979 has owned Necker Island in the Virgin Islands where he created his entire estate in which he lives. However, in the past year our great CEO has turned the island into a secret military base which will allow the complete invasion of the British Virgin Islands. With the British Expeditionary Forces overextended Branson will surely be able to make an agreement with the British state once he has taken control."
 cayman.3.d:0 "As it would turn it out the literal corporate take over of one of Britain's overseas territory has not gone entirely unnoticed. While the Crown would love the island to be running rampant as a tax haven and corporate paradise they would still like to keep the prestige of ruling the possession de jure. While at first this sounds like a pointless request Kenneth Dart actually finds this offer appealing, he has only achieved so much control in the Caymans by being secretive and low profile and maybe its best to return to that way."
 cayman.4.d:0 "With the obliteration of the Belize state which clearly can't balance the most basic of budgets, its time to put Dart managements' Vice President in charge to teach these Belizeans a thing or two about fiscal responsibility."
 newscayman.1.t:0 "Dart Enterprises formally establishes a Corporate State in the Cayman Islands"
 newscayman.1.d:0 "The secretive billionaire Kenneth Dart has been buying up property in the Cayman Islands for years but when the chaos of the Second American Civil War came he began to use his de-facto control of the island more directly. Establishing a state based solely on the rights of corporations and billionaires, we will have to see what disgusting acts of greed this entity will commit."
 newscayman.2.t:0 "Prince Andrew takes the reins of the Cayman Islands"
 newscayman.2.d:0 "In response to the complete corporate control of the Cayman Islands the Prince Andrew given his business connections has made an interesting deal with Dart Enterprises. In return for allowing complete unregulation of all corporate activities on the islands, Prince Andrew will be a figurehead leading the possession for the Crown. However, the Prince has shown himself already to be a bit more involved than he may have previously been stating, with an executive act which provides complete legal immunity to himself."
 newscayman.3.t:0 "Richard Branson's Virgin Group has established the Virgin State Ltd."
 newscayman.3.d:0 "Billionaire Richard Branson has purchased the Cayman Islands from Dart Enterprises for over $30 billion. Virgin losing operability of their Hyperloop track and Space Center due to the American Civil War, Richard Branson used his investment portfolio in the British Overseas Territories to his advantage. Many are left to ask however, with Virgin back in control, will we see a new wave of a corporate space race?"
