Suarez was no military mastermind but he knew how to speak to the masses. Soon his voice was playing over every single radio and TV in the area. \n\n"My fellow Floridians. We must during this trying time come together as one. The forces of evil and destruction lie at our gates and if we continue to fight, we will become only a distant memory in the pages of history.
