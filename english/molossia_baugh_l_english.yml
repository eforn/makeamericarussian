MOL_birth_of_a_micronation:0 "Birth of a Micronation"
MOL_birth_of_a_micronation_desc:0 "Molossia stands in a precarious position. With socialists to the west and religious fanatics to the east, the young nation has few friends. Yet its internal issues - a need to accomodate the steady tide of refugees, the lack of real control exercised by the Molossian government - could smother Molossia in the cradle if not tended to."

MOL_deciding_our_future:0 "The Road Ahead"
MOL_deciding_our_future_desc:0 "Kevin Baugh has a major decision to make about the exact nature of Molossian governance. On one hand, he could use his influence to push for democratic governance, working to establish an assembly and eventually holding elections. Alternatively, he could centralize leadership around himself, using his personal authority to move Molossia forward. How shall we proceed?"

MOL_the_issues_at_hand:0 "The Issues at Hand"
MOL_the_issues_at_hand_desc:0 "Without a proper legal code, economy, or political system in place, we're at quite a fragile moment in our young nation's lifespan. With over a thousand refugees already taking shelter in our nation and more arriving each day, our nation could become overburdened without immediate action."

MOL_house_the_refugees_desc:0 "The \"tent towns\" we have constructed to house refugees will not cut it forever, and we face a dilemma in how to proceed.

MOL_molossian_republic:0 "We Are a Republic!"
MOL_molossian_republic_desc:0 "If we are to survive, we cannot rely on the leadership of a single individual, or a small group of individuals. By allowing the people of Molossia to elect representatives to positions of power, we can better understand their concerns and more effectively keep Molossia afloat. Democracy it is!"
MOL_republic_path:0 "Baugh shall work to bring democratic governance to Molossia!"
MOL_create_assembly:0 "Work with Community Leaders"
MOL_create_assembly_desc:0 "We are not yet ready to hold elections, but that should not stop us from seeking as much input from the Molossian citizenry as possibly.

MOL_hoist_the_flag:0 "Molossian Liberty"
MOL_hoist_the_flag_desc:0 "To many in our territory, the idea of \"Molossia\" is little more than a joke taken too far. It is time to forge a Molossian set of values. In the tradition of those first railroaders who settled Dayton in years bygone, Molossia shall be build around personal liberty, with our government providing people the framework they need to pursue success in their personal lives."
MOL_molossian_democracy:0 "Promise Elections"
MOL_molossian_democracy_desc:0 "What is a democracy without elections? In order to demonstrate our sincerity, we will announce plans to hold elections for \"positions of community leadership\" in the near future.

MOL_time_for_a_constitution_desc:0 "Molossia needs a constitution."
MOL_imperial_presidency:0 "An Imperial Presidency"
MOL_imperial_presidency_desc:0 "The idea is a bit... unsteady. The authority Kevin Baugh has currently arose as much from the folly of others as from his own skills and talents. But nobody can deny that these last few months have been some of the most tumultous in American history. Perhaps Molossia needs a strong and benevolent President to guide it through these times."
MOL_dictatorship_path:0 "Kevin Baugh shall take a more central role in Molossian leadership!"
MOL_a_central_position:0 "Baugh Takes Center Stage"
MOL_a_central_position_desc:0 "If Kevin Baugh is to be a genuinely influential leader, he cannot simply be the figurehead he has been at times. He must be an active, insightful, and multi-talented leader who plays a lead role in guiding the Molossian state through the trouble surrounding it. It is time for President Baugh to up his level of personal responsibility and make himself irreplaceable."
MOL_listen_to_people:0 "The President's Speeches"
MOL_listen_to_people_desc:0 "It is not sufficient for Kevin Baugh to be essential to the Molossian government. He must be endeared to the Molossian people, so they see him as a benevolent president who could do well with more responsibility."
MOL_lesson_in_history:0 "Backroom Dealing"
MOL_lesson_in_history_desc:0 "To ease the resistance of centralizing more power in Kevin Baugh's hands, we must begin to quietly circulate stories about how a more centralized leadership structure would benefit Molossian governance."
MOL_final_preparations:0 "Falling into Place"
MOL_final_preparations_desc:0 "Through our efforts, Kevin Baugh has gradually become more influential in Molossian governance. There are still more speeches to hold and officials to persuade, but the time has almost arrived."

MOL_internal.61.t:0 "A Failed Harvest"
MOL_internal.61.d:0 "Two months ago, the refugees residing in our country worked to set up a farming program. The result has been a complete failure. Due to a combination of poor soil, a general lack of agricultural infrastructure, undesirable weather, famine, and plain old incompetence, we have barely been able to harvest any crops whatsoever."

MOL_internal.62.d:0 "Two months ago, the refugees residing in our country worked to set up a farming program. The results have been disappointing, with Molossian soil being unproductive and the crops we managed to harvest being of generally poor quality. However, we were able to salvage a limited amount of food, and we can use this in meals for refugees."

Due to the ingenuity of our refugee laborers, favorable network, the effective usage of greenhouses, and a multitude of other factors, we truly have a bumper harvest of good-quality crops. Molossia will not need to worry about food for quite some time now, and a feast is being held to celebrate the surprising success."
