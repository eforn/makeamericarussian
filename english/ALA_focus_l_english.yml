 ALA_The_First_Emperors_of_Alaska:0 "First Rulers of Alaska"
 ALA_The_First_Emperors_of_Alaska_desc:0 "The main issue with the Wagner group was lack of political justification for the regime.

 ALA_Palins_Pardons_desc:0 "As much as we would love to throw all of those bastards in jail there is one harsh reality that faces us… we need them.

 ALA_Speak_out_against_the_Commies_desc:0 "Following the collapse of the Pacific Fleet regime, political radicals came out of the woodworks due to the loosened grip on power. While that allowed the recreation of a democratic government, that does mean that there are a lot of radical leftists who can now openly profess their beliefs. Normally we would not care in such a Republican state like Alaska, but with our proximity to Bernie’s California, and then by proxy the Chinese, we cannot risk any leftist influence. We must clamp down."

Trump and Palin were both commonly seen by Republicans as outsiders and people who did not necessarily play by the book in politics.

It is time for our number 1 and their number 45 to talk."
 ALA_Secret_treaty_with_Biden:0 "Meet with Biden"
 ALA_Secret_treaty_with_Biden_desc:0 "It is time to reach out to the Washington government.

 ALA_denounce_hardcore_leftists_desc:0 "There were a lot of socialists and communists that rallied behind our election campaign as we were the closest thing to a functioning left wing party.

 ALA_President_Watts_desc:0 "President Watts narrowly won the election. He campaigned on the near dissolution of our government and establishing a state based on rural lifestyle and self-determination. Often described as a “libertarian on steroids”, Watts was ridiculed for his extreme libertarian sentiments especially about taxation and gun laws."
 ALA_The_Land_of_Preppers_and_Hunters:0 "Land of Preppers and Hunters"
 ALA_The_Land_of_Preppers_and_Hunters_desc:0 "Alaska was not made for suburbs, or cities or resorts. It was made for rural farms, it was made for hunting towers, it was made for bunkers. This great state was and should be built on taking from the land and fighting against the state. Everyone is their own judge, jury and executioner and are free to make their own choices."
 ALA_Abolish_Taxation:0 "Abolish Taxation"
 ALA_Abolish_Taxation_desc:0 "Taxation is government sponsored theft. The act of taking citizens hard earned wealth is legal burglary and we must eliminate it once and for all. Read my lips Alaska, there will be no taxes."
 ALA_Self_Governance_to_the_Communities:0 "Communal Self-Governance"
 ALA_Self_Governance_to_the_Communities_desc:0 "Leaving state policy making up to the capitol in DC was a terrible idea. Having a state government was an even worse idea. Potentially an equally bad idea was even having local and county level governments as well. However, we shall recognize the benefits of leaving all policy making up to individuals and independent municipalities. It makes more sense for the individual, or a household, or a small town to understand their own needs rather than some fat cat wearing a suit in a capital hundreds if not thousands of miles away."
 ALA_Hand_out_Government_Spendings:0 "Hand out Government Money"
 ALA_Hand_out_Government_Spendings_desc:0 "The government has taken millions of dollars to the people. In order to prevent a socialist style of handling our government’s riches, we simply looked up people’s money spent on taxes and gave back what was taken from them. We then shall take the rest of the money and give it out to the free market through careful investments and bribes."
 ALA_Self_Preservationism:0 "Self Preservationism"
 ALA_Self_Preservationism_desc:0 "Everyone has a right to their own destiny in these woods. Everyone has the right to whatever ideology, belief or goals they wish to achieve and having the state boss them around is communism in disguise. Everyone has the right to their own future, as well as the right to defend their future at all costs."
 ALA_Encourage_Boogaloo_Militias:0 "Encourage Boogaloo Militias"
 ALA_Encourage_Boogaloo_Militias_desc:0 "Having an organized public police force is tyrannical and systematically broken. Having a privately funded police force in the form of militias however would be a better idea. Towns forming their own militias and then having them compete with each other to ensure safety would be great for peacekeeping and for business. We no longer are a state to “back the blue” we are now a state to “back the boog”."
 ALA_Stop_Identity_Politics:0 "Stop Identity Politics"
 ALA_Stop_Identity_Politics_desc:0 "Identity politics is an excuse on both sides to rally around people to vote for policies against their own interests. Democrats use it with minorities to pass things like woke social reforms and Republicans use minorities to justify having no social reforms at all. Under our Alaska we do not care who you are, fuck or pray to so long as you stay off our lawns."
 ALA_The_Frontierist_State:0 "§YEmbrace Frontierism§!"
 ALA_The_Frontierist_State_desc:0 "Many call Alaska the state of the “final frontier”. They call us this because of how vast and unexplored we are. Our tall mountains, massive forests, great ocean and snowy tundra outshines any dingy old cinder block home in Juno. We shall create a new frontier for our people. One where there is no law enforcement, or hospitals, or government intervention or massive economic monopolies. The government and militias only exist to protect the interests of everyone as well as have a mild yet quiet voice in international affairs. Here is to the great hike, the great journey, the great frontier!"
 ALA_President_Krumm:0 "§LPresident Krumm§!"
 ALA_President_Krumm_desc:0 "President Krumm has seized the presidency. A new dawn for Alaska and America has begun!"
 ALA_Reach_out_to_Hawaii:0 "Reach out to the Islands"
 ALA_Reach_out_to_Hawaii_desc:0 "We need to reach out to our brothers in the islands. Our cause has grown weak since we failed the invasion back in California, but with enough efforts we can easily have a new attempt at forging our way back."
 ALA_Rally_the_Vets:0 "Rally the Vets"
 ALA_Rally_the_Vets_desc:0 "Many veterans of the Sanders offensive still hold fond memories of our rule. Now that we are back in an administrative setting, we can now rally many of the old vets behind our cause. This could also boost some much needed legitimacy with our government being despised by most civilians."
 ALA_Pardon_Aquilino:0 "Pardon Aquilino"
 ALA_Pardon_Aquilino_desc:0 "Aquilino was a brave man who did what he had to do for the fleet and subsequently for his country. Because of that, those dirty fucking civilians locked him up and threw away the key. By top fleet orders, Aquilino is to be pardoned, have his criminal record wiped and is to be granted all of his ranks and privileges back. 
 ALA_Launchpoint_into_America:0 "Strike South"
 ALA_Launchpoint_into_America_desc:0 "The time has come to expand southwards. We will begin to grow a stronger Alaska for a stronger fleet."
 ALA_Alaskan_Columbia:0 "Hail Columbia!"
 ALA_Alaskan_Columbia_desc:0 "The fleet was not just a fleet of patriots, it was an idea. An idea that the American experiment with democracy has failed and the only way to preserve it is through benevolent military rule. We do not serve the constitution, as it failed our nation. We do not serve a congress or senate as they doomed our nation down this path. We pledge allegiance to either the pretender governments of the Trump or Biden regimes. We do not pledge allegiance to democracy or liberty. We pledge our allegiance to our Columbia, or homeland, our America. We live and die to serve America!"
 ALA_Restore_the_Navy:0 "Restore the Navy"
 ALA_Restore_the_Navy_desc:0 "The navy was essentially dissolved following the collapse, if we are to make any progress in restoring this great country we need to reinstate the navy. All decommissioned boats are now back in service, all sailors shall receive pardons and compensation, all ranks shall be reinstated. The Pacific Fleet shall control everything in this ocean from Anchorage to El Salvador."
 ALA_New_Tactics:0 "New Tactics"
 ALA_New_Tactics_desc:0 "The main reason behind our collapse was that the civilians under our administration were rebellious seeing the failures of the California offensive. The main reason we lost that war was not having proper naval invasions or air support for our troops. We shall learn where we failed and come back twice as strong."
 ALA_The_Second_Pacific_Fleet:0 "§LThe Second Pacific Fleet§!"
 ALA_The_Second_Pacific_Fleet_desc:0 "The civilian government has been entirely destroyed. Any opposition has been jailed or shot, the military is now fully mobilized to expand into the west coast and the heartlands of the country. It is now up to us to make them pay for what they did to us. It is now up to us to destroy those who destroyed this country and rebuild this nation anew. These bastards betrayed our America, we shall have heads on pikes lined up every street in Denver, DC and San Francisco."
 ALA_Alaskan_Expansion:0 "Alaskan Expansion"
 ALA_Alaskan_Expansion_desc:0 "If Alaska is to survive, we must expand our borders through whatever means we can."
 ALA_Peaceful_Reintegration:0 "A Peaceful Doctrine"
 ALA_Peaceful_Reintegration_desc:0 "We are not in any position at all for rapid expansion. It would be silly for anyone to suggest Alaska goes off and forms some great imperial domain or reforms some fictitious new America. Instead we shall approach the concept of expansionism on a small scale and as diplomatically as possible."
 ALA_Reach_out_to_Vancouver_Socialists:0 "Work with Vancouver Socialists"
 ALA_Reach_out_to_Vancouver_Socialists_desc:0 "The Vancouver socialists would be a better fit to reach out to in consoling our government’s relations with our neighbors. They would most likely align with our government and are to be the best possible people to talk to in these frozen northern lands."
 ALA_Reach_out_to_BRC_Conservatives:0 "Work with Wexit Conservatives"
 ALA_Reach_out_to_BRC_Conservatives_desc:0 "The Wexit conservatives would be a better fit to reach out to in consoling our government’s relations with our neighbors. They would most likely align with our government and are to be the best possible people to talk to in these frozen northern lands."
 ALA_Land_for_Subjugation:0 "Land for Subjugation"
 ALA_Land_for_Subjugation_desc:0 "A new deal has occurred that will allow Alaska to gain better control of the area. We shall sell vast amounts of land with civil autonomy in exchange for political subjugation."
 ALA_Integrate_Cascadia:0 "Integrate Southern Alaska"
 ALA_Integrate_Cascadia_desc:0 "Now that we have established proper control of the region, we shall now properly annex our newly acquired territories."
 ALA_Remove_American_Identity:0 "Remove American Identity"
 ALA_Remove_American_Identity_desc:0 "We are no longer like the rest of the lower 48. The lower 48 tore each other apart and killed the most powerful country the world had ever seen. We are not proud of the American part of our history, rather we see it as years of occupation and ignorance by DC elitists. Alaska is Alaska, and anyone who calls our land home is Alaskan."
 ALA_True_Alaskan_Borders:0 "Borders of True Alaska"
 ALA_True_Alaskan_Borders_desc:0 "Alaska’s borders were drawn by Russians and colonists back in the year of 18 who gives a shit. It was so long ago that honestly the borders of Alaska could easily be up for interpretation. There are various peoples and terrains that surround us that logically should be part of a greater Alaska. Realizing this now, our administration shall strive to form a Greater Alaska!"
 ALA_March_to_the_Mountains:0 "March to the Rockies"
 ALA_March_to_the_Mountains_desc:0 "We shall march to the Rockies to ensure the expansion of our great Alaska. Today is a new day for the future of the Rockies, Alaska and the disunited states."
 ALA_Cascadia_IS_Alaska:0 "Cascadia IS Alaskan"
 ALA_Cascadia_IS_Alaska_desc:0 "Cascadia is nothing more than just a more urban version of British Columbia. British Columbia of which, is part of our rightful borders which logically makes Cascadia rightfully Alaskan."
 ALA_End_Montana:0 "Burn Montana"
 ALA_End_Montana_desc:0 "Montana is barren and lacks any identity for themselves other than being northerners in rural midwestern America. They are part of our rightful domain and we shall do everything we can to bring them back into the fold."
 ALA_Reunite_America:0 "Reunite America"
 ALA_Reunite_America_desc:0 "THE TIME HAS COME! THE TIME TO REFORM AMERICA IS UPON US MY BROTHERS! LET THE SECOND AGE OF MANIFEST DESTINY COMMENCE! GLORY TO THE FLEET! GLORY TO THE REGIME! DOWN WITH TRUMP! DOWN WITH BIDEN! GLORY TO AMERICA!"
 ALA_Alaskan_Armed_Forces:0 "Alaskan Armed Forces"

 ALA_Expand_USCG_Kodiak:0 "Expand USCG Kodiak"
 ALA_Expand_USCG_Kodiak_desc:0 "The USCG Kodiak is the gem of the Alaskan navy. We shall do everything we can to modify her and strengthen her to be the pride of our ocean defenses."
 ALA_Use_Fishing_Vessels_for_Cargo:0 "Borrow Fishing Vessels"
 ALA_Use_Fishing_Vessels_for_Cargo_desc:0 "Many ships in our fleet ended up being taken by the Hawaiian government or captured by the Californians to sell to the Chinese. Our navy is in a very sorry state and if we are going to do anything about it we need as many ships as possible. By executive order, commercial fishing boats shall be purchased from civilians to serve as destroyers and battleships."
 ALA_Trade_Portection_Doctrine:0 "Trade Protection Doctrine"
 ALA_Trade_Portection_Doctrine_desc:0 "We do not need a large navy. A large navy is what took away our democracy and put us at war with the Californians. Bringing back a large navy could easily lead to another dictatorship or another meaningless war. Our new navy should do one thing and one thing only, defend our commercial trade."
 ALA_Create_Island_Landing_Strips:0 "Create Island Airports"
 ALA_Create_Island_Landing_Strips_desc:0 "Island airports would be one of the best defensive and offensive tactics we can invest into. By having secluded areas to hold our airports we can easily mobilize our boys in the sky to take down any enemies as quickly and discreetly as possible. It also allows us to have better troop transportation over such wide land."
 ALA_Enhance_Bomber_Research:0 "Enhance Bomber Research"
 ALA_Enhance_Bomber_Research_desc:0 "Bombers would be a perfect investment for our blossoming air force. The ability to lay down absolute hell from the sky would be perfect as many of the warlord states have not formalized any air forces."
 ALA_Scorched_Earth_Bomber_Doctrine:0 "Scorched Earth Bomber Doctrine"
 ALA_Scorched_Earth_Bomber_Doctrine_desc:0 "We have adopted a doctrine that we shall use for our air force known as Scorched Earth Doctrine. Essentially speaking, our bombers and pilots shall kill and destroy everything within a certain radius until the rubble they are bombing has turned to pebbles and ash. This will ensure a brutal way to dominate the battlefield and the skies."
 ALA_Expand_National_Guard_Outposts:0 "Expand National Guard Outposts"
 ALA_Expand_National_Guard_Outposts_desc:0 "We need to have our military defend our borders and our cities from froeign threats. In order to do so, National Guard outposts will be established everywhere within 5 miles of the border or some city. This way, we can have the military keep tabs on all of our defenses."
 ALA_Open_Officer_Schools:0 "Open Officer Schools"
 ALA_Open_Officer_Schools_desc:0 "The pardons of all of the military higher ups lead to a massive brain drain in the command of our armed forces. Those who could not be reformed into our new military should be replaced, and the best way in doing so is by creating new officers. In order to do so, we need to open up proper training facilities to forge a new executive commanding rank force."
 ALA_Swiss_Defensive_Strategems:0 "Swiss Defensive Stratagems"
 ALA_Swiss_Defensive_Strategems_desc:0 "Perhaps the most famous example of holding a defensive position in an area covered in snow and mountains would be the swiss. For decades, the Swiss have been able to defend their sovereignty using their terrain and forts; we can easily learn from this."
