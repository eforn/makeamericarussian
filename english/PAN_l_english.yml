 chiriqui_separatism_desc:0 "People from the province Chiriquí have Panama’s most prideful identity and a separatist spirit that would make a Texan proud. Approximately 20 years ago, Chiriquí was virtually isolated.  The highway from Panama City to David was in terrible shape, effectively cutting off Chiriquí from the rest of Panama, breeding sentiments of secession. As infrastructure projects and modern technology better connected the province of Chiriqui to the capital, Chiricano secessionist movements began to lose traction. That was until the United States collapsed into civil war and Panama was thrown into turmoil. Now, as instability threatens the existence of the once prosperous Central American nation, Chiricanos once again seek secession in a bid to jump from the sinking ship that is the Republic of Panama."
