The dream of my mentor Charles Manson will be a reality someday. I need all of you to work to stop the enemy by any means necessary. Together, as true Florida Men, we can lay waste to more than just a mere police station" \n\nA roar came from the croud as they gathered around Watson ready to hear what his plans were."

In their wake, death, famine and destruction were rampant. This army of evil now gathered in the Miami Government buidling to witness the birth of a new era. \n\nTex Watson stood on top of a balcony, silver baseball bat in hand. At his feet was the Miami head Police Chief, naked and handcuffed. Watson looked over the crowd of his loyal followers then he looked towards the ground. "Charles" he said softly. "Your plans are coming to fruition. Soon the world will know humanity's true nature. Soon they will see we are all animals." \n\nWatson then turned his gaze to his soldiers. He slowly raised his bat over his head with both hands. His men began to yell, shout and holler like caged animals. The police chief looked towards Watson with a fleeting look of hope in his eyes. Watson would show no hope. He began to beat him into a paste on the ground with the bat. Strike after strike cracked bones, cut tissue and opened wounds. After 15 minutes, the chief could hardley be recognized. Watson then began to slowly cut off the battered poliece chief's head with a small knife. Blood splattered over his face as he went. Watson merely licked it from his lips. With a thundering yell of "Anarchy!" he hoisted the severed head into the air. His men roared and even began to hit one another. This was truly madness in its most raw form..."
