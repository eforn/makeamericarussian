#A Canadian Contender
 vancouver.0.t:0 "The Vancouver Army"
 vancouver.0.d:0 "With the outbreak of the Canadian Civil War, soldiers on duty forced to fight on the front lines have gone completely AWOL. In Vancouver, the story is very different, though. Many soldiers of the 3rd Canadian Division have flocked to the area in the search of a more fair society. These troops have willingly joined the Vancouver force and are ready to defend its territory until their death. The process of integrating the remaining 3rd Canadian Division soldiers has begun and has served as a major piece of propaganda for the fledgling state of Vancouver. This has caused an influx of volunteers to help defend Vancouver, blostering the ranks of the army."
 vancouver.0.a:0 "To arms!"
 
#Western Canadian Convention Event
 vancouver.1.t:0 "The Western Canadian Convention"
 vancouver.1.d:0 "Following the collapse of Trudeau’s government and rising tensions along political borders, we called for a convention among the Canadian pretenders in western Canada to determine the fate of the west. Given our political differences, coming to an agreement on foreign and domestic policy could prove troublesome. Should we collaborate with our political rivals or carve our own path forward?"
 vancouver.1.a:0 "Western Canada Stands United"
 vancouver.1.b:0 "No Concessions!"
 
#MARPAC
 vancouver.2.t:0 "The Maritime Forces Pacific"
 vancouver.2.d:0 "The Maritime Forces Pacific, or MARPAC, was responsible for fleet training and the operational readiness of the Canadian Navy in the Pacific Ocean. Due to our control over Victoria Island and subsequently CFB Esquimalt, the MARPAC's main base of operations, we have naturally inherited the MARPAC and its command staff."
 vancouver.2.a:0 "Anchors Aweigh!"
 
#The Vancouver Terror
 vancouver.3.t:0 "The Vancouver Terror"
 vancouver.3.d:0 "Our government’s increasing acceptance of authoritarian policies have swayed the public squarely against us. This past month has seen a near constant riot in the streets in protest of our government. As a result, we have deployed the national guard to pacify the protesters, resulting in thousands of deaths after responding to riots with deadly force, and raiding the homes of those suspected of inciting violence and instability."
 vancouver.3.a:0 "It will work this time."

#Vancouver Terror News Event
 vancouver.10.t:0 "Communists Seize Vancouver!"
 vancouver.10.d:0 "In the chaos of everything going on in Canada, local communists had seized various buildings and established a new regime. Many of the liberals and more moderate socialists were arrested or purged as the communists did everything in their power to seize the apparatus of the state. In response to the new regime, many people took to the streets to protest, demanding the return of elections and a multi-party democratic system. The world had their eyes locked on Vancouver, would this be the fall of the brief socialist regime or would this be another incident of bloodshed; sadly the second answer was the case. Hundreds of Vancouver protestors were shot dead in the streets by red militias as the crowds of protestors dispersed into the streets. After an event many are nicknaming “The Terrible Thursday Incident”, many are saying that this is the North American equivalent to the Soviet crackdowns of the eastern bloc countries or even more infamous; an American Tiananmen Square massacre. It appears the spectre of communism has grown to hold more territory in the Pacific."

#Ultimatum to Western Canada
 vancouver.6.t:0 "Vancouver Demands Our Annexation"
 vancouver.6.d:0 "We have received an ultimatum from those socialists in Vancouver. They demand complete state submission and the annexation of our territory. They wish to do this peacefully to prevent adding on to the conflict and they state that any territory that willingly joins them shall receive autonomy and pardons. On one hand, Vancouver has grown much stronger since the civil war started and perhaps joining them would allow us to form a new and better nation without the cost of war. On the other, we cannot anticipate the stability of their socialist government from extremists. We separated from those leftists in Ontario not just because they abandoned the crown but they had abandoned all of Canada’s true values. However, the idea of going back into conflict is not popular among our citizens and maybe it is for the best. How shall we proceed?"
 vancouver.6.a:0 "We are left with no choice."
 vancouver.6.b:0 "Request limited self-governance."
 vancouver.6.c:0 "We will not collaborate with leftists. To arms!"
