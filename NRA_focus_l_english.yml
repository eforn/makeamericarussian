Supreme Leader Carlson knows this all too well, and many worker revolutions have been crushed due to failing to fight the neoliberal order. Not only that, but our revolution in particular is facing the remnants of the ex-world’s strongest military power, meaning we cannot afford to be idealistic about our military doctrine when defending against outside threats. Several strategies have been drawn up that are being considered, with one of the more popular ones being to rely on a smaller but elite trained army that can at least be on par with the remnants of the US army. Other propositions are more theoretical, including ideas like mass conscripting the workers to have safety in numbers, or allowing local bands of revolutionaries to undertake a guerilla war similar to the theories presented by minds like Mao and Gonzalos. We must choose wisely, for our choice can be the matter of life or death for our revolution…"

Not only that, but our policy of self reliance is one that encompasses all Appalachians, not just the ones within West Virginia. Even ignoring that, who are we to call ourselves communists if we do not wish to free our proletarian brothers and sisters when they are being enslaved and exploited right next to us? So it is time for us to ask ourselves a crucial question. Where do the borders of worker liberation and self reliance end?"

Regardless of how one views the “legitimate” president, none can deny that they still hold remnants of the US army within their ranks, which do not bode well for our revolution and its goals. As it stands currently, we cannot even begin to hope that an offensive push would be possible, so we must prepare for the eventual push on their end. We must lay down guerilla defenses in hopes of doing damage to the future invaders. Secret armories within villages, bunkers across our northern border, tunnel systems in key areas, booby trapping key infrastructure, etc. Every worker within our nation must be ready to do what's necessary in defending our revolution, even if it means facing total annihilation and spitting in its face."

However we cannot waste a single day to wait, the state will bring in legions of workers to work tirelessly in building a bunker system across our northern border, as well as other borders in preparation for future attacks by other capitalist dogs that surround us.

We will propose an alliance between our two nations that we will dub the Charleston Pact, an alliance that will be defined by smaller nations banding together and defying the larger imperialist bourgeoisie who seek to destroy our self reliance and determination. Not only that, but if we maintain our position as the head of the Pact, then we will be able to influence each member’s government to be more aligned with the cause of worker’s self-reliance for Appalachia.

For administrative purposes, we will allow the state of Kentucky to still exist under a newly appointed government that falls in accordance with our policy of Workers self-reliance and promoting Appalachian culture. Naturally, we will also have to crush any notion of separation and the idea that Kentucky residents are different from our Appalachian workers culture.

So, we will invite the government of Virginia into the Charleston Pact, hoping to diplomatically unite the two states that broke off so long ago.

Currently the city is controlled by the very workers we seek to liberate and give self reliance to, free from foreign outsourcing and accursed rust that has plagued Appalachian and Rust belt industry for decades. Given their current position, we can easily exploit their need for security. We can either approach them with an offership of membership in our glorious nation state and give them the security in numbers they need, or we can go for the more direct approach of military invasion.

So, Supreme Leader Carlson is considering a drastic measure, given the now weakened position of the Federalists after their defeat, the workers of Appalachia will initiate our own invasion of their land, taking our enslaved brethren back by force.

We will mount a full offensive war with the short term goals of taking Tennessee from West’s slaver worship, as well as having the long term goal of liberating the entirety of the Southern states. Taking the entire south will not only help us liberate the workers and restore the proper cultural tenants of being Appalachian in the areas needed, but it will also allow us an ample amount of land to deter any sort of invasions from outside forces, such as Trump’s tyranny or other capitalist pawns that wish to end our revolution.

We have marched on the capitalist warlords, repelled the Federalist hordes, followed Supreme Leader Carlson without question, all in the pursuit of liberating Appalachia and its culture. By all metrics, we have achieved our ideology of self reliance for the workers and their culture, therefore making our goal accomplished. However, within the heart of Supreme Leader Carlson, there is a sense of unfulfillment. Sure, it is an amazing feat that we have been able to liberate the workers of Appalachia and free their culture from both domestic and foreign capitalist reliance, but there exists a sense of hoarding within our Supreme Leader’s mind. Appalachians are their own unique and glorious people true, but are Appalachians not also Americans? Look outwards towards the rest of America, and you will see the same capitalist warlords and oppression that once plagued Appalachia plaguing the entirety of the past USA. From the Midwest to the Southwest, American workers are all being enslaved, and their culture is being destroyed for the sake of profit.

Whilst they unfortunately have lost their way, and their culture is being tainted by capitalism once again, that does not mean we still cannot be on good terms with them. We will approach the Russian government in Alaska for control of the state once again, offering certain liberties such as military access and what not.

However, that does not mean that the workers in our nation are all mindless idiots who only know how to drink and fight, many community members hold knowledge that the general public would benefit from, and given a lack of proper teachers within the nation, they would be prime candidates for tackling our literacy problems. The state will assign them to be public teachers, sharing the knowledge that they know to younger members of our nation that will help lay the groundwork for eliminating literacy in our workers. Granted, this has the risk of giving rise to certain members teaching unsavory ideas to our nation’s youth, but we cannot afford to be picky with eliminating literacy. Any amount of literacy gained is positive, whether it be secular or religious."
