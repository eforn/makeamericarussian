 Our_Unique_Situation:0 "A... Unique Situation"
 Our_Unique_Situation_desc:0 "Our situation after separating from the People's Republic of America is unstable to say the least. Being wedged between Cascadia and the PRA puts us in a bad spot, not to mention our holdings in Nevada. However a certain failed Nevadan politician by the name of Naxalt has offered to meet up with Schwarzenegger to discuss stabilizing our fragile nation."
 Legacy_of_Republicanism:0 "Determine the Legacy of Republicanism"
 Legacy_of_Republicanism_desc:0 "After Trump ignited the 2nd Civil War, the view of Republicanism across the nation has become even more polarized, and it is no different here in Jefferson. Though we are right leaning, arguments over whether the GOP were the USA's saving grace or downfall have erupted, and it seems the Governator needs to take a stance on the party's legacy."
 The_2nd_Reagan:0 "The 2nd Reagan"
 The_2nd_Reagan_desc:0 "Our leader, Arnold Schwarzenegger, former California governor, Hollywood superstar, The Governator, is the 2nd Ronald Reagan! With his moderate teachings, hatred of the radical GOP, and right-wing economics, he is the best candidate to lead our nation! Hail to the new chief, Hail President Schwarzenegger!"

 Work_Across_the_Isle_desc:0 "In order for our government apparatus to work properly we need to cooperate with the democratic politicians residing in our country, and that requires extending a hand and cooperating with them."

 Denounce_Radicals_desc:0 "The radical republicans within our state work against all that we hold dear, and they must be terminated. President Schwarzenegger will make a speech in our capital denouncing Trump and the radical wing of the GOP."
 Work_Towards_A_Peaceful_Resolve:0 "Work Towards Peace"
 Work_Towards_A_Peaceful_Resolve_desc:0 "We, like any other sane warlord in America, don't want unnecessary fighting with other cliques. The People's Republic of America, although more left than we like, is way larger than us and could likely crush our statelet if they wanted to. It is because of these two reasons that we should cooperate with Bernie and try to come to a peace agreement."
 Work_With_Bernie:0 "Work With Bernie"
 Work_With_Bernie_desc:0 "The former leader of the People’s Republic of America, Bernie Sanders, has lost control of most of California and is now cornered on all sides by hostile states. Sanders is desperate for allies, and that's something the Governator can offer."
 Work_with_the_Latinos:0 "Work with Latinos"
 Work_with_the_Latinos_desc:0 "The Latinos of the self-proclaimed “Alta California” are in a dire strait. Being in one of the most underpopulated areas of California doesn’t do them any favors, not to mention the language barrier between latinos and english speaking americans. Surely they can use some help from our president The Governator!"
