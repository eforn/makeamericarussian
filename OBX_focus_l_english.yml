We accepted, glad to bring our neighbors in the Outer Banks into our realm and provide them with a safe haven. We have governed and protected them since the collapse; however, with the Republican revolt in the Appalachians, the Outer Banks have now declared independence from us."

obx.2.d:0 "Amidst the tranquil landscapes of the Outer Banks, a secluded region that has carved its identity on the sands of time, a unique community thrives. Comprising the northeastern corner of North Carolina, the Outer Banks emerged as a distinct entity, detached from its once-shared lineage with Virginia. This isolated community stands as a testament to the resilience of families who have weathered generations, cultivating a distinctive way of life amidst the rugged, swampy terrain."

The choice before them weighs heavy — to reaffirm their ties or to carve a new journey. As the winds of change stir, the Outer Banks finds itself at a crossroads, reevaluating its allegiance to forge a destiny united with either Virginia or the Confederate States of America."
obx.3.a:0 "Why are you even doing this path?"
obx.4.t:0 "A Meeting"
obx.4.d:0 "Today is an important day for the recently born Outer Banks nation. Leaders and elders from towns and communities from across the Banks, whether it be from the islands or on the mainland, have gathered in Nags Head for a discussion on where our nation will go from here. Ever since our independence from Virginian occupiers, the Outer Banks as a whole haven’t really been focused on goals that concern the nation as a whole, but fears of outsiders coming back to rule our communities have only been rising as of late. So, community leaders have come together in order to discuss potential options for what the future the Outer Banks will hold.\n\nAnd discussion were going mildly well, until commotion was heard outside. At first, security guards appointed to overlook the meeting got calls on their walkie talkies to deal with a situation outside of the premises. About 5 minutes later, more commotion was heard outside, with yelling and gunshots being heard. Confused, one of the leaders got up to look outside of the window, and only then was the seriousness of the situation revealed."

obx.5.d:0 "Eventually, a security guard ran into the meeting hall to explain the situation to the leaders inside. He explained that the guards posted outside of the building saw a large group of strangely dressed men sprinting towards the building, looking like, and I quote, “Those fuckers from that pirate movie”. The men were carrying things like makeshift cutlasses, guns that were fashioned to look like blunderbusses and flintlocks, and some mad man even brought out what appeared to be a cannon and was getting ready to fire it. Before the leaders inside could process this information, a loud BOOM was heard and the building shook, getting hit by something.\n\nThe security guards and these strange men got into a firefight, quickly losing ground in the building to these pirates. Eventually the guards barricaded themselves in the hallway in front of the meeting hall where all of the leaders were, prepared to receive the pirate’s final attacks. Eventually, the pirates attempted to rush at the guards with their cutlasses in their hands, with the guards firing entire magazines of their pistols into the horde."

The captain was none other than Carl Cannon Jr, a man who frequently believed himself to be the heir to none other than the legendary pirate Blackbeard himself.\n\n“Avast Ye, landlubbers and bilge-suckers! As captain of the newly proclaimed Pirate Republic ‘ere in the Outer Banks, I absolve ye of your positions, as well as your lives! Dead men tell no tale, and ye all will feed the fish!”\n\nAs he finished saying this, him and the pirates ran towards the leaders, and began to kill them all. Some were decapitated by the cutlasses, others got ridden with bullets, but none survived to tell their communities what happened here. After the massacre was over, the captain and his crew stood as the new authority of the Outer Banks!"

After the premises were searched and cleared of any hostiles, examination of the bodies revealed the leader of these pirates to be Carl Cannon Jr, a local who was known for his pirate themed persona before the collapse of the USA. It seemed he had been leading the charge against the security team, but was fatally shot once he reached the hallway the guards were barricaded in. The guards believe that his death was the reason why the charge ended, leading to the pirate’s retreat. The local police department put the town under curfew to root out the rest of these pirates, and community leaders were escorted back to their lodging with the goal of continuing the discussion tomorrow."

The final decision was one of harsh truths, one filled with the realization that the Outer Banks will never be enough for our people. Our communities have never had any sort of semblance of separatism from the mainland, as we saw ourselves as North Carolinians first and foremost. Not only that, but despite having centuries of separation between the North and South, there have never really been that much of a cultural divide between the peoples of North and South Carolina. So a plan was devised by those present at the meeting, one that could define or defeat their movement as a whole. Interim leader Donald McRee proposed contacting various secessionist groups in the Carolinas, which will then be used to disorient and rush the Confederates into signing a peace that will give us our states back. Groups such as that will be easy to find under the insanity that is the CSA, and when the time comes to eventually face the CSA, the resistance groups will rise up to take back their homes."
obx.8.a:0 "We can only hope that the insanity down south keeps them busy..."
obx.9.t:0 "Atlanta Is Ours!"
obx.9.d:0 "Our plan worked! Carolinian millitiamen fighting for the cause of secession have captured Atlanta, crushing the remnants of the Confederate authority there, and taking the Confederate government hostage! With most of the government in our hands, we’ll enforce our demands of both Carolinas from them, otherwise they’ll be forced into a post mortem retirement. As cruel as it may seem, we cannot allow the Confederates to gain an inch on the negotiations table. Either they give our homes back to us, or we take their lives."
obx.9.a:0 "God bless those Militiamen!"
obx.10.t:0 "Militia Groups Disband"
obx.10.d:0 "As we celebrate our victory over the Confederate tyrants, it is time to deal with the militia groups that helped us achieve our goal. Whilst there are some in our government that believe that these militias should act as the foundation for our new nation’s army, we unfortunately cannot do so. The men and women that comprise the militias are civilians, those who were brave enough to raise their fists against Confederate tyranny and save their homes from further bastardization. We cannot in good conscience force them into a life of military service, as their contributions to our nation’s independence was purely voluntary. We will properly award every one of them, and memorialize their names as those who believed their homes were more important than the ravings of madmen."
obx.10.a:0 "None shall forget their deeds, as they gave everything when they had nothing"
obx.11.t:0 "Carolinian Republican Primary"
obx.11.d:0 "As the first united Carolinian elections draw closer, the United Carolinian Republican Party’s primary will be held to determine who amongst them will be the party’s candidate. Because the Republican Party is a merger between the Northern and Southern Carolinian parties (hence the United in the name), there is a variety of individuals that will be given the chance to propel their views to their party, and hopefully towards Carolina as a whole. Currently, there are three candidates that are believed to have the best chances at becoming the nominee.\n\nThe first candidate is Nikki Haley, ex-governor of South Carolina and ex-ambassador to the United Nations. Her platform takes on a more neoconservative angle, being a supporter of a free market system that she says will be the perfect launching point for the new Carolinian economy. She also supports a somewhat aggressive foreign policy, one that some fear will ruin relations with potential allies. Not only that, but her experience as South Carolina’s governor makes many feel as though she is a good starting point for the new Carolinian government as a whole.\n\nThe second candidate is Tim Scott, a businessman and former junior senator of South Carolina. Scott’s platform appeals to traditional values, believing in concepts such as increased religious education in schools and more benefits to community churches. Whilst his past of supporting Trump has raised a few eyebrows to those who have been paying attention, Scott no doubt holds popularity amongst the more religious minded members of the Republican Party, believing that traditional values will help bring the new nation together.\n\nThe third and arguably more controversial candidate is Mark Robinson, a man who served briefly as Lieutenant Governor of North Carolina before losing his job due to the collapse of the USA. Robinson is controversial even for Republicans, as he often subscribes to conspiratorial views and anti-semetic rhetoric. There are claims that Robinson believes the collapse of the USA was a part of a grander conspiracy, with the perpetrators only being referred to as “them” by Robinson, with many theorizing that he means members of the Jewish culture. Regardless of his controversial beliefs, there are still those within the Republican Party that agree with his talking points.\n\nAs the United Carolinian Republican Party primary comes to a close, the votes have been counted, and the results are…"
obx.11.a:0 "Unsurprisingly, Haley’s experience won her the vote"
obx.11.b:0 "Scott’s fear of God has granted him the candidacy"
obx.11.c:0 "Shockingly, Robinson’s conspiracies have won over the party"
obx.12.t:0 "Carolinian Democratic Primary"
obx.12.d:0 "As is tradition within the remnants of the USA, the Democratic Party for a United Carolina have organized their primary, and will be choosing who amongst them will be the candidate for the Carolinian presidency. Much like their Republican rivals, the Democrats in Carolina are a hodgepodge of different yet technically united individuals who all have their own platforms that they want Carolina to be influenced by. Whilst the Democratic Party might not have the best reputation, they are still dedicated to helping the people of the new nation, with three candidates being believed to have the best chance at gaining the candidacy.\n\nThe first candidate is Jeff Jackson, an ex-military officer/attorney who also served as a congressional district representative in North Carolina before the collapse. Jackson is somewhat of an unorthodox candidate for the Democratic Party, as he takes a more center-left platform with the sole goal of being a man of the people. His platform believes in things like government transparency and anti-corruption within the government, and if elected his policies will attempt to make Carolina a more honest and corruption free nation. Despite leaning towards the center, Jackson has a following of people who believe the best thing a first president should be is honest.\n\nThe second candidate is Roy Cooper, ex-governor of North Carolina and the prime candidate within the polls. Cooper’s platform takes the face of the traditional modern Democratic platform, believing in more traditional liberal tenants like having the system serving the collective community, as well as proposing mild socially liberal reforms that will help accomplish that goal. His appeal to the wider Democratic Party as a whole mixed with his experience makes him the prime candidate.\n\nThe third candidate is Jim Clyburn, retired educator and ex-representative of South Carolina. Clyburn is seen as the radical option amongst the Democratic Party, as his platform propels staunch progressive policies and civil rights advocacy. Believing that the best starting point for Carolina is a social democratic system, Clyburn promises to make Carolina a nation where all peoples can be represented, as well as expanding things such as welfare and workers rights in order to give the more worse off members of society a fighting chance. Despite being seen as more radical by the older democrats, Clyburn nonetheless has those within the party that follow his mindset.\n\nLike many before it, the primary is coming to an end, and the votes will speak volumes on how the party views the future of Carolina. The winner of the Democratic primary of Carolina is…"
obx.12.a:0 "Jackson, his transparency winning the people’s favor!"
obx.12.b:0 "Cooper, his traditionally liberal points appeased the party!"
obx.12.c:0 "Clyburn, his progressive policies appealed to the masses!"
obx.13.t:0 "Earnhardt Jr. Pulls Into The Race"
obx.13.d:0 "The Carolinian election pool just got more diverse today as Dale Earnhardt Jr., famous NASCAR driver and son of the famed Dale Earnhardt Sr., announced that he will be participating as a candidate for the Carolinian presidency as an independent candidate. In various public speeches and news appearances, Earnhardt’s policies are viewed as taking elements of both Trumpism and the beliefs of the Southern Democrats of old. Mixing elements of nationalism with the old philosophy of Jacksonian Democracy, Earnhardt believes that mixing an extremely small government with Carolinian pride and nationalism is what this new nation needs in order to go into the future as a united nation. Whilst it is yet to be seen whether or not Earnhardt’s campaign will actually gain enough traction to be a serious candidate for the presidency, none can deny that the former NASCAR driver has gained a following, despite many similarities between him and Trump…"

obx.14.t:0 "Buffett Docks And Joins The Race"
obx.14.d:0 "More unexpected news comes regarding the election, as famed singer and restaurant owner Jimmy Buffet has made an announcement saying that he will be participating in the race for the Carolinian presidency. To many, Buffet was never seen as one to delve into politics, given his often laid back and nonchalant nature. Buffett’s policies also give rise to confusion, being a mixture between environmental conservatism, pro-military policies, and an almost reorganization of Carolinian culture. His promises to subsidize alcohol and legalize various substances like marijuana and LSD have given him controversy amongst the more politically established groups in our nation, but also has given him a stable support base amongst the younger generation of people in Carolina. Whilst it is not clear where Buffett’s chances are, there are some who are hopeful that the laid back singer could give Carolina a new mindset."
